Now what if the car was something sportier like a corvette? Last week we introduced the ANOVA model which allows us to compare measurements of more than two groups, and today we‚Äôre going to show you how it can be applied to look at data that belong to multiple groups that overlap and interact. Most things after all can be grouped in many different ways - like a car has a make, model, and color - so if we wanted to try to predict the price of a car, it‚Äôd be especially helpful to know how those different variables interact with one another.

I had to go on a little stand type thing, and say things...but when I went up there I froze in fear and then I tried to say what I had to, but I messed up my words, forgot to say some words, and kept pronouncing things wrong! Then after the program most of my Family who came to see me do the program all said I did great and I just felt SO uncomfortable because I'm an introvert and I actually knew I did bad...

SNYpl1hCu3w,nonclickbait,1174,How would you change Android's gesture system if you could? - Dieter,Even though i don't like iphones but have to admit gestures on iphone are way simple and clean,"This is also what makes the Taptic engine so great. When I swipe up on my iPhone I get physical feedback. It's very satisfying. Anyways, really nice to see WebOS, that design was ahead of it's time.","This is probably the best video review on ""Android P beta"". Thanks to *Verge*","Dieter will always and forever be one of my favorite tech journalist. Why? Because he gets it. Dang, once I saw that Pre 3 on the table the nostalgia hit haha. So far I'm loving the gestures on my Essential, and I definitely agree with your jank statement.","When you brought up WebOS, I literally said ""Spot on bro!."" Great episode, Dieter!",I have to say iOS gestures looks lot more refined,"the X's gestures are ridicolously natural and fluid. google's are very robotic and half baked, but since it's a beta i'm hoping they manage to fix that","I *almost* went and powered on my Palm Pre again Dieter, almost! God damnit, haha","That comment on jank is pretty spot on. Early builds of Androids didn't catch on because they were janky. Non-vanilla builds of Android was hated on because they were janky. Jank pretty much permeates throughout the history of Android. Gestures must convey a cohesive UX, and any jank will kill that immersion.","Android P has a new way to navigate your phone: gestures. But in the early beta they're not very good yet. In this episode of Processor, Dieter looks at why Google might have created the new system (and, yes, he breaks out his Palm Pre 3).

qLGpKBrDP-w,nonclickbait,149,"Anyone who keeps nagging about bezel size on a tablet, you are definitely not much of a reader. On a phone, you want the finger to have a better reach and you wanna be able to use the edge swipes quickly so having small bezels makes sense. But try holding a 10, 12 or even worse a 14-inch tablet with small bezels and you will see why they have left it there. the problem is, you guys keep nagging, and the manufacturers keep listening to you because that is the feedback they get. It's like the slim trend in smartphones which enthusiasts pushed until some ridiculously thin phones with low battery life and without headphone jack became the norm. After a while, you realise there are more important things and you start saying ""I guess a bit of bezel won't kill me if it means better ergonomics""","They made the bezel large so you can rest your thumb in Tablet Mode. Honestly, I think its a silly idea",Who cares about Alexa?,I think the big bottom bezel is there for the tablet mode. To have somewhere to hold onto without randomly clicking.

Btw, would it be possible to do follow-up videos for some tech products?  For example, how about a video ‚ÄúLiving with the Yoga 730 for 6 months‚Äù? This type of a video would give viewers a feel of the durability as well as the different ‚Äúeveryday use cases‚Äù of the product. Of course, please ensure your wider audience base is actually interested in something like this before you commit to making such videos. So maybe try it with a couple of vids and see if the business model is sustainable. Just a thought. Thanks again and keep up the good work.","Lenovo‚Äôs Yoga 730 has Alexa built in and a familiar design with some subtle but stylish changes. The Flex 14, also known as the Yoga 530, takes those changes down to an even cheaper price point with an option for a built-in GPU. Subscribe: https://goo.gl/G5RXGs

The transition to DFTBA profit going to Partners in Health actually (because of how our accounting works) extends back through the entire last year. Profit that isn't going to PIH is either being held as an ""operating reserve"" (basically 'just in case"" money) or distributed to small minority owners who helped us with investment when we needed it. 

This might be a tad confusing because DFTBA is a separate company from Complexly (our production company). So the money DFTBA.com makes is profit from providing services to creators (including Complexly.) Complexly (and all of our other creators) will keep making money as normal. So DFTBA's profit is going to PIH, while the money Vlogbrothers makes from selling stuff is still going to Complexly as it's an important part of how we keep the lights on!

Business is fun! If you have any questions, hit those comments!

Let's take a look at some of the most incredibly innovative vehicles around today, and a few of them are so secret you won‚Äôt even find on the road. 

A few of them are already available to us folks, others are in the testing phase, while still others are prototypes. One criteria used in making this list was that the vehicles couldn‚Äôt be mere concepts, they had to be real in all the glory that glass and metal can muster. 

Here‚Äôs a look at the best of what high-tech and the transportation industry have to offer, some of them offering bonuses to that sweet ride you might be looking for, while others might even challenge your idea of what an incredible advanced vehicle might look like.

Asylum is one way that refugees come to America. If you‚Äôve already fled your home country for fear of persecution, and come to the United States, but don‚Äôt have refugee status, applying for asylum is the next step you take. It‚Äôs a small subset of the American immigration system, but it‚Äôs the mechanism behind so much of the news about border. 

Families recently separated from their children at the border came seeking asylum. People fleeing from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador ‚Äî an  area known as the Northern Triangle ‚Äî come to the United States seeking asylum. To even get a hearing before an immigration judge, potential asylum-seekers have to prove that they have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúcredible fear‚Äù of returning home. And this is where that backlog really begins.

Science is developing at a faster rate than ever before. When we look back at what we‚Äôve achieved over the last 100 years, we can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what more we‚Äôll find out in the next few decades. But while we‚Äôve got many diseases under control, thanks to cures in the form of pills and immunisations, we haven‚Äôt quite got everything fixed yet. Sure, we know exactly how to proceed with most infections and we‚Äôre confident in removing many limbs. But there are still hundreds of unknown syndromes out there, puzzling doctors all around the world. From the babies born with two heads to the toddlers who are suddenly struck down with an unknown illness and are never the same again. Who knows how long it‚Äôll take to find the solution to these unknown diseases?

On 6th of June 1944
In the early hours they say,
150,000 troops
Assembled on beach that day.

Nine allied Nations gathered
To fight to liberate,
Europe from Hitler's Germany
But thousands met their fate.

From up there on the clifftops
German troops were waiting,
To rain hell fire on Allied troops
There was no debating.

23,000 paratroopers
And over 5,000 ships too,
Also called ""Operation Overlord""
This information all true.

By Daylight Allied forces
Were in control it's said,
Nearly 10,000 casualties 
And over 4,000 dead.

Within the next five days
Allies brought some more,
326,000 troops
Landed on Normandy shore.

54,000 vehicles 
From Nine allied Nations,
104,000 tons of supplies 
For this military operation.

Remember these brave souls
On 6th of June okay,
Because of them we're all free
Liberation was D Day.

By
William Mckechnie alias Wild Bill Entertainer","This was a beautiful tribute. These people are wonderful and inspiring. I can't imagine the hell they went through. We need to keep our veterans in mind every day, of every year. It saddens me to think of the vets who don't have loved ones and pass away all alone.",They were so brave.  We can never fully know the sacrifice they endured for a free world.  Now we owe them the next fight for peace and freedom,"THANKS TO PRESIDENT MACRON,FRANCE ,FOR HONORING USA WW2 VETERANS TODAY ,D DAY,ALSO MRS MACRON ,A BEAUTIFUL ,GRACIOUS LADY",Never Forget!,"The greatest generation.

While many of us have ‚Äúpie in the sky‚Äù dreams and want to live like royalty, it doesn‚Äôt come easy! When it comes to celebrity living, we know that they want the best of the best - and they can afford it. Many of us are just getting by renting but celebrities have the world in their hands. If they‚Äôre an A-list celeb, then they can afford to have multiple million dollar mansions. We‚Äôve all dreamed about building the house that we would call our permanent home. Video games are created out of this dream where we can create anything we want inside our house. Celebrities are lucky enough to live in this reality. Some of the places they live are massive enough to outdo castles! Since most of us don‚Äôt live in mansions, we can live vicariously through some of our most beloved celebs. In fact, their mansions will simply take your breath away and leave you in a certain level of wonderment and awe.

So if you already have a smartwatch, chances are you‚Äôre not going to go out and buy another one to upgrade what you have. 

My Gear S2 Classic still performs *great* and does everything I need my watch to do: look good, show me notifications, control the music on my phone, and the occasional app use (Samsung Pay, Uber etc.). There is *no* incentive to go out and get a new one like there is for a phone.",Dieter seriously you need an award,Style of his presentation has changed!

Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite‚Äôs whole world is contained in the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner.

Michael Marder explores the science of dust.

Many people were forced from their homes during the wildfires that swept through California in November 2018. Some of these people didn't have homes to go back to. A 93-year-old man named Lee was one of these people who was forced from their homes. Fortunately, he met a kind woman named Tracy. She tried to feed him, and when the air in the parking lot where he was staying became too dangerous, Tracy took him home. 
Lee had no idea if he would ever be able to go back home and Tracy and her boyfriend made him a promise. If he couldn't return home, they would make their home his home. The news interviewed the three of them, and the footage is sweet and incredibly touching. You have to see the video to see what true kindness looks like.

evMaRUhNxl0,nonclickbait,311,"After seeing this movie today it was very beautiful. Amazing cinematography and the new cast added their own twists to the characters I love. Of course the real animals wouldnt be as expressive as cartoons, but the additions Favreau included to the character dimensions worked well to honor the movie (particularly Shenzi). I'd say my only complaints were downsizing Be Prepared and Scar's complexity as a villain. Adult Simba also should have been a bit more interesting but that was a folly in the original as well. Overall, very funny and musically wonderful. Definitely met my expectations.","I loved the movie but the way they changed the song of Be Prepared was sort of a flop. Also, no offense beyonce has a beautiful singing voice but the character just didn‚Äôt fit her voice as she was talking",They probably casted Beyonce mostly for her star power. She's definitely a great singer but....,Disney really needs to focus more on the original content and animated feature films after this!,"Groundbreaking? It's just a remake, calm down.","Look, it's going to be good,but lets be honest it can never be on the same level as the original.",Another remake of a movie from a by-gone era?.... establishment running out of ideas.....,They did an incredible job bringing the classic to life. However I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the voice cast overall. Why not bring back Nathan Lane as Timon for example? Felt like they changed it just to change it.,Went in with low expectations and was completely blown away.  Loved it.  Now there‚Äôs 2 Great Animated films & 1 Great musical üëç,Never miss it;  one of the great wonders of #Disney world ; it's worth watching it more then 10 times i loved it deeply...,"Filmmakers and stars from the 1994 film, musical and new movie, from Beyonce, to Donald Glover to Jon Favreau, discuss how the story came to be the global phenomenon it is today.

Lots of people's lives were also getting worse during this time, thanks to the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade. And these two shifts were definitely intertwined.

Abs are 20% in the gym and 80% in the kitchen. You need to hit them HARD with WEIGHTS and not just your body weight.
Drink water, most likely need to do some kind of cardio as well and eat really strict. (I know I had some candy lol but first time in a LONG time) haha 
This works for me. White meats and pretty much no carbs. Water throughout the whole day. Eat SMALLER portions but eat MORE often during the day & WORK HARD!!!

Americans are notoriously bad at voting, but it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre unpatriotic or lazy. It‚Äôs because most states make it really difficult to even register to vote. 

It‚Äôs time for the US to join other advanced democracies and implement automatic voter registration. It will make the voting system more accurate and more secure, plus it could give nearly 50 million eligible Americans a chance to decide how their country is run.

Science has answered so many of our questions, but there are many more still left to answer. With more answers comes even more questions, because science isn‚Äôt bent on explaining life simplistically and coherently. Science is complicated, and the complications seem ever-growing. Just when scientists think they have everything figured out, a new theory comes along to complicate the matter even more. However, what makes it so frustrating is what also makes it the best system for understanding reality. Why would anyone assume that unlocking the secrets of the universe would be easy? Look around you: it‚Äôs all crazy, and science does all it can to make sense of the crazy. But we must be patient. The burden of proof on scientific theories is the heaviest of all disciplines. A theory only becomes a law when every possible variable can be accounted for, which is why scientific questions have so many answers.

After the ball drops in Times Square on New Year's Eve, the crowd cheers, couples kiss, confetti flies and the song you hear is ""Auld Lang Syne."" For Americans this song is associated with another year passing, but it means something else entirely in other cultures. Since the Scottish poet Robert Burns first published the words to the song in the 18th century, the melody has been adapted as a soccer ballad in the Netherlands, a graduation song in Japan, and more. 

This video explains how an obscure Scottish folk tune took on new life around the world and how Guy Lombardo solidified it as the sound the US hears at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

Others choose more exotic pets such as snakes, turtles, and lizards. There are certain animals that don't make good pets. Bears, lions, tigers, and gorillas are all dangerous and usually illegal choices for pets. In the 1970s a family in the Soviet Union kept real lions as pets in their small Baku city apartment. Unfortunately, this is a tragic story of one Soviet family having three lions as pets. 

The patriarch of the family, Leo, was a typical Soviet architect. He was at the zoo one day, and he heard about a lion cub who was in trouble. The cub was rejected by his mother, and the people who worked at the zoo were trying to bring him up themselves, but they were giving up hope. Leo decided to take the cub home so that he and his family 
The family named the cub King. His front paws were paralyzed which made it difficult for him to walk. To help him, the family would massage his paws often so that he could start walking on his own. It didn't take long before King was a member of the family. 

The family lived in a small apartment, which made it a bit cramped as King got bigger. The young cub started to get attached to the family. King loved Leo, and it wasn't long before he started to love Leo's wife, Nina as well. When they went to bed at night, King would sleep between the couple. The family tried to bring King back to the zoo once. They figured that since they had nursed the lion back to health, that he would be better off with other lions. On the way back to the zoo, King became very angry and was jumping all over the car. When they got back to the zoo, they were told that since King had grown up with humans in a family, that he would never be able to go back to living with other lions. 

The family's neighbors in the apartment complex didn't like the idea of a 400-pound lion living in the building. When King was settled into his home life, word about a family raising a lion and they began getting offers for King to do movies. They agreed, and it gave the family a chance to travel all over the world. They were also able to meet plenty of movie stars. Sadly, tragedy was just around the corner. 

The family was staying at a hotel while King was filming in St. Petersburg City. At night, King was kept at the local school. The hotel couldn't take any chances by letting him stay with his family at the hotel. The lion was trained to go up to his costar and put his paws on his shoulders as soon as the trainer began moving around like an ape. A local student heard that there was a lion at the school, so he and his girlfriend went and checked it out. The assistant, Sasha, who was in charge of caring for King stepped out to get something to eat. This was when the student and his girlfriend showed up. He started acting like an ape, which was King's cue to put his paws up on his shoulders. The student's girlfriend panicked, thinking that King was hurting her boyfriend. She screamed for help, and the police arrived. Without hesitation, they shot King, and he died. The family was devastated. The dog family dog, Chap, was also destroyed. He ran around looking for King. When he couldn't find him, he sat in one of King's boxes. The next day, poor Chap died of a heart attack. The family was sure that the dog died of a broken heart. The children were also sad. Finally, Leo decided to get another lion to help them feel better. 

The new lion's name was King II. Unfortunately, he wasn't as sweet as King. Leo also brought home a mountain lion who he named, Puma. King II wasn't as kind or gentle as King because the family saved King's life and they helped him to walk. They didn't do these things for King II, so the bond wasn't there. Nina didn't agree with Leo bringing home Puma or King II. They tried to get them a spot in Berlin's zoo in Eastern Germany. It was almost a done deal, but it didn't go through. 

Sadly, in 1978, Leo had a heart attack, and he passed away. This left Nina in charge of their children and the two lions. She said that it was far too much for her to deal with. Now that Leo was gone, King II missed his master and he wasn't being as nice as he once was. 

He was very nervous when Nina's 14-year-old son came home. She was cooking her son a meal and slicing meat for King II when the lion fell from his perch onto his back and was injured. He roared at Nina and started to attack her. Her son quickly tried to help by grabbing the leash. King II lashed out at her son and killed him. Nina lost consciousness. When she woke up, the police had killed King II, and Nina's son was dead. 

This family's story is a perfect example of why lions are not meant to be family pets. While things were great with the original King, the family never should have tried to recreate what they had by bringing two new lions into the home.",458.0,qslkmLwJE_I,10719.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qslkmLwJE_I/hqdefault.jpg,A Tragic Story of a Family Who Had Three Lions as Pets,597653.0,clickbait,2019-05-08T13:00:14.000Z,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,15.85203125,23.862051169923767,41.10615437764419,32.754068287037036,40.60840584449787,64.96159804251513,79.45087384259259,74.5715216037989,41.10615437764419,clickbait,,clickbait

Not only was this music festival set to take place in the Bahamas, but festival-goers were promised a luxury experience like no other.

This Guy Is Selling The Moon And Making Millions Of Dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIYT_FSeJX8

Models like Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber even appeared in the promo video, enticing people to shell out thousands of dollars to feel part of the elite crowd. But, as you probably already know, Fyre Fest turned out to be a complete fail. Not only did Blink-182 pull out of the lineup the day before the festival began, but the festival itself was also canceled soon after.

For the unlucky ones who arrived in the Bahamas before hearing the news, they arrived at a festival site that wasn't yet ready to receive them. Fyre Festival's organizers, Billy McFarland and Ja Rule, were clearly to blame. But where did things go so wrong? In court, a judge would go on to call Billy a ""serial fraudster."" Make sure to watch this video to get the inside scoop on the Fyre Festival disaster.

The screen is so much brighter and the sound is definitely louder. I'm looking forward to trying out the music streaming feature when I work out.  Already took calls on it and it really was convenient to do so. If you are on the fence about upgrading, I'd say if you have a series 1 (original 2015 watch) it's worth it to upgrade to the series 4. If you have a newer watch, then probably not.","Hey Apple , are you listening
This is the presentation .","The Apple Watch Series 4 has been fully redesigned with new screens, new sizes, new speakers, and of course new stuff inside. There's a faster processor, Bluetooth 5, and a more accurate set of sensors. Dieter Bohn spent the past week testing the Watch Series 4 and, yes it is expensive, but everything is just better. Better screen, better health features, and better speed.

In this video you‚Äôll see breeds like the Tibetan mastiff, which is so rare that purebred puppies can sell for as much as $2 million; the Carolina dog, which is related to the dingo and was discovered in a nuclear reservation in South Carolina; and the otterhound, which was bred specifically for otter hunting, but when otter hunting became illegal the otterhound became endangered. We‚Äôll also tell you about a breed that was created as part of a Czechoslovakian science experiment, a breed that hunts gazelles on the African savannah, and a breed that dwindled to six individuals but was saved by a few heroic breeders. Most of the breeds in this video have global populations of less than a thousand ‚Äì which is a staggering fact when one considers that there are over a million golden retrievers in the U.S. alone.

Many kids get an allowance from their parents. They earn money by helping out around the house, doing chores, and doing yard work. Many kids get their allowance and spend it on themselves. Some spend their money right when they get it on candy or small toys. Others like to save up their money so that they can buy something that they really want. Ryan Kyote is a 9-year-old boy from West Park Elementary School in Irvine, California. He got an allowance, and he liked to save it. Usually, he bought sports equipment or video games with his allowance. There was one day that he decided to do something much more special with his savings. 

All students in California are allowed a hot lunch at school. Under California law, if a student doesn't have the money to pay for their lunch, they cannot get one. West Park Elementary School does things a bit different. Students pay for their lunches based on their income. If they don't have the money, it is listed as an unpaid balance. When the school year ends, and the students have a balance, the school district absorbs it. If a student cannot pay, they would be given a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Until the balance is paid, they won't get a hot lunch. 

Ryan was at lunch one day getting his hot lunch when he saw his classmate sitting there with no lunch at all. The student's school lunch balance was low, so he went hungry. Ryan felt bad for his classmate. He didn't think that it was right that his friend had to go hungry just because his parents couldn't afford to pay. He had a way to help, but he wanted to talk to his mother about it first. 

When Ryan got home, he talked to his mother, Kylie Kirkpatrick, about the student who was forced to go a day without lunch. He told his mother that it wasn't fair that his friend was not able to eat and that he had to sit and watch his friends eat. Ryan told Kylie that he shared his lunch with his friend, but he wanted to do more. He asked his mother if she could find out how much money his classmates owed on their lunch balances. 

Kylie wasn't sure that she could get the total balance for the class, but she wanted to know why Ryan was asking. He told his mother that he wanted to use his allowance to pay the balance for all of this classmates' unpaid meals. Kylie was stunned. She knew that Ryan had been saving up for months to buy something special for himself. The fact that he would spend all of his hard earned money on his friends blew her away. She thought that it was a cool idea, and it showed how caring her son really is. 

Kylie sent an email to the Napa Valley Unified School District. In the email, she explained that her son wanted to pay off the outstanding lunch balances for his friends, and she needed to know what they owed. She was told that the third-grade students at West Park Elementary School owed $74.80. 

Kylie told Ryan how much his classmates owed, and he wanted to pay the balance. Kylie wanted to make sure that Ryan was sure about spending his savings on his friends. She didn't want him to pay off the balance, and then regret it later when he didn't have the money to buy what he was saving for. Ryan assured his mother that he wanted to use his money this way. 

The next morning, Ryan went to school with an envelope that contained $74.80. He brought it to the office, and he told the secretary that he wanted her to put the money toward his classmates' overdue lunch balances. The secretary says that she was shocked. She asked Ryan where he got the money, and he told her that he had been saving his allowance. 

Stacy Rollins is the Napa Valley Unified School District spokesperson. When asked about Ryan's kind gesture, she said, ""This was a very considerate and special donation, and the district applauds the efforts of the student who has shown compassion to his school and fellow classmates.""

Everyone who heard about what Ryan did for his classmates expressed their feelings. Most said that he had to be a really great kid to spend so much money to help others. For adults, $74.80 isn't a whole lot of money. For a kid, it is a whole lot of money. What Ryan did was selfless and amazing. If there were more kids like Ryan in the world, it would be a better place. This 9-year-old uses allowance to pay off lunch debt for his entire class. Amazing.

Man! What a powerful quote. This quote itself explains why one should read Edgar Allan Poe",Ted-ED just keeps delivering,‚ÄúThe most powerful emotion is fear. And the greatest fear is fear of the unknown‚Äù,"That picture of Edgar Allan Poe you described in the beginning. Pale skin, sunken eyes.

Well that was a picture taken after a failed overdose. They were taking a picture of him cause they thought he was gonna die and they were gonna use said picture to make paintings of him to remember him by.

*quite a common practice at the time*

He was actually quite a handsome man.",Such a clever animation of a great writer.  I can't help but smile and think that Poe would have approved of the style in which you portrayed him and his work.,Great music choice,"The man is a great *Poe-t* , amiright?

The prisoner strapped under a descending pendulum blade. A raven who refuses to leave the narrator‚Äôs chamber. A beating heart buried under the floorboards. Poe‚Äôs macabre and innovative stories of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? Scott Peeples investigates.

Look no further than Airbnb.

Ever since it was founded in 2008, Airbnb has been a great way for travelers to cut costs and for homeowners to make a bit of extra cash‚Äîor a lot of extra cash, depending on the property in question.

Not all Airbnb properties are created equal. You can rent anything from a sleeper van that's seen better days to a castle with seventeen bedrooms. And no, we're not kidding about the seventeen bedrooms. Need to see it to believe it? Check out this video to get all the details on a castle in the Loire Valley of France that can be rented out for just $15,500 per night. This castle has a three-night minimum, meaning you'll have to splash out over $52,000 to stay in a place that can host you and your closest 31 friends. 

If castles aren't your thing, why not spend over $30,000 for two nights on an Airbnb yacht that'll take you around Alaska? Thankfully, this nautical Airbnb listing includes gourmet meals. As these two examples quickly proved, Airbnb isn't always budget-friendly. In fact, you can quickly break the bank if you're the kind of person who needs to keep up with the Joneses. If you want to see eight more properties that'll leave you in a perpetual state of FOMO, TheRichest has got you covered! From a desert mansion in California that once had its presence graced by Lady Gaga, to a luxurious abode in Bora Bora that'll cost you over $650,000 to rent on a monthly basis, these Airbnbs aren't for the financially faint-hearted. You might not be able to afford any of them‚Äîwe certainly can't, but they're definitely still fun to look at!

Every successful athlete needs a spectacular house. It‚Äôs not enough that they‚Äôre already beloved for their athletic accomplishments, they have to be beloved for their sense of real estate style too. Seems odd, doesn‚Äôt it? Well, that‚Äôs celebrity life. When an athlete transcends the barriers of their sport, they become an image‚Äîan image that they must fight at all costs to improve or at least maintain. A fancy house is simply part of that image. But the tide seems to be changing regarding the public pressure on celebrity ostentation. Fans don‚Äôt seem to care as much about how big their idols‚Äô mansions are, as evidenced by the smaller and less cartoonishly big homes professional athletes are buying. They‚Äôre more appreciative of the ingenuity. As long as the house looks cool, or sports some cool features, the public can sleep comfortably. So check out this video of ingenious athlete homes so you can sleep comfortably as well.

Marketing stunts are something that can make headlines for both good and bad reasons. They take careful planning and scheming in order for them to work out. Why the effort? If you want your business to go viral and reach a ton of people in a short amount of time, you would consider pulling off a marketing stunt. This usually involves doing something extreme that gets the attention of the public and makes them want to find out what you‚Äôre all about. Sometimes, these marketing stunts are major hits and they bring awareness to the company that‚Äôs running the operation. However, more often than not, marketing stunts are major misses. They usually get our emotions involved in a situation. After we find out that the scenario was fake, we feel cheated and manipulated, thus leaving a bad taste in our mouth. Even though marketing stunts are usually a bust, that doesn‚Äôt stop companies from planning the next one.

The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is a list of remarkable constructions from ancient times. However, only one of the seven landmarks on it still stands today, making the list seem kind of outdated for our modern world. So, in 2007, a new list was created to reflect the seven wonders of the world that can still be visited today. Over 100 million people voted online, and the Seven New Wonders of the World are: the Great Wall of China, the city of Petra in Jordan, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Machu Picchu in Peru, Mexico‚Äôs Chichen Itza, the Colosseum in Rome, and India‚Äôs Taj Mahal. The Great Pyramid of Giza was also given honorary status, as it's on the original Seven Wonders list. But which landmark deserves to be the eighth Wonder of the World? We'll look into the significance of five landmarks from around the world in this video, which all deserve to be number eight in their own right.

Millions of Americans commute to work. It can be a stressful journey that involves cars, trains, bicycles, and even airplanes. This video breaks down the pros and cons of long commutes -- it's by someone who actually has a painfully long one: Vox's Kimberly Mas commutes to Manhattan almost every day. She drives her car to the train station, takes the train to the subway, and finally rides the subway to the Vox office. She's had this routine for a long time and she always wondered what kind of toll it's taking on her. Her reporting shows that, while commutes may just be an unavoidable part of life for many Americans, they don't have to be all bad, all the time.

Many people get sick during the winter months. Colds and the flu are very common between November and March. Many people who get sick during the winter don't bother to go to the doctor. Since there is no cure for the cold and the flu needs to run its course, many people just wait it out and take over the counter medication to treat their symptoms. In most cases, the illness and symptoms run their course. In other cases, the cause of the symptoms is much more serious than the common cold or the flu. 

Shayla Mitchell was 16-years-old when she woke up feeling sick. She had a nagging cough and assumed that she might have had a cold or a sinus infection. She thought that she could wait out her illness only to find that her cough wasn't getting any better. Finally, she asked her father, Tom, if they could go to the doctor. She just wanted to start feeling better. Tom told his daughter that he would schedule the appointment and he would pick her up the next day after school. He told her that after the appointment, they would get something to eat. Coughing teen asks dad to take her to the hospital ‚Äì within hours, he's left broken. 

Shayla and her father went to the doctor the next day. After the doctor examined Shayla, he left the room for a bit. When he came back, he had news that would change her family's life forever. The doctor said that Shayla had a large cancerous tumor that took up 2/3 of her breasts. It was so large that it caused one of her lungs to collapse which is why she had had such a bad cough for so long. Shayla and her father were in shock. Rather than going out for dinner, they had to share a meal in the hospital. They had no idea that day that they would be eating their next 450 meals in the pediatric oncology unit at Fairfax Hospital. 

Shayla was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, and her prognosis wasn't good. Tom was determined to stand by his daughter and do everything that he could to get her healthy again. He wanted to show Shayla that she had his full support and he brought a bracelet for each of them. He promised to wear his bracelet every day until she beat cancer. 

For the next few years, Tom spent hundreds of nights with his daughter while she battled cancer. She had to go through chemotherapy, radiation, blood transfusions, multiple tests, and she even went into cardiac arrest. Through all of this, she never gave up the fight. It was difficult for both Shayla and her father, but he never left her side. He was by his daughter's side when she cried, vomited, and when she was in intense pain. He tried to be brave, and he is even braver. 

One day, Shayla's doctor came into the room and told her father that her body was no longer responding to treatment. They told him that there was nothing that they could do for her. She had a bone marrow transplant as a last ditch effort, and it failed. 

Tom created a Facebook post and published it on the Love What Matters page. In his post, he wrote, ""How in the world was I supposed to have this conversation with my darling daughter? How can I be brave enough to tell her that she was going to die."" His post was very moving. He says that he realized that Shayla wasn't being brave for herself. She was being brave for her father. 

Shortly after Shayla died, Tom thought about her promise. She promised to be brave to the very end, and Tom knows that she was. She went through endless pain and treatment trying to fight for her life. Tom says that there is nothing braver than that. 

When Shayla died, Tom started a nonprofit to help kids who are suffering from cancer. Because he and Shayla promised always to be brave, he called the nonprofit, Still Brave.org. 

Tom needed to keep Shayla's memory alive, and his foundation did that. He says that not a second goes by that he doesn't miss his daughter. Still, Brave.org is his way to stay close to his daughter. Tom says that his daughter's bravery inspired him to be just as brave. He hopes that the foundation that he started can help others in Shayla's situation. He says that she was a trooper right to the end and he will forever treasure the time that he had with his daughter.

World War I began in July 1914. Many people believe that it would be over by Christmas; however, it didn't work out that way. The fight went on for four long years. 

A key concern during the war for the British was the security of their maritime supply routes. The country depended on its merchant fleet to bring essential war supplies and food from the United States to other countries. The Germans were aware of this, and they used the U-boat to disrupt Britain's merchant shipping processes. 

An ocean liner, the RMS Lusitania left New York's Pier 54 in May 1915 bout for Liverpool, England. There were 2,000 passengers and crew on board. Most of the people on the ship were British and Canadian, and there were over 100 American nationals on the ship. The ship was also carrying 750-tons of ammunition and other materials necessary in England. The Germans used the military items on board as justification for what they did to the ship. 

The Lusitania was 750 miles from Ireland on May 6, 1915, and there was a German ship nearby. The next day, the U-boat captain, Walther Schwieger, scanned the horizon with the periscope and saw the ship. He took the boat down to a cruising depth of 36-feet and headed for the ship. When in range, they launched a torpedo, which shot right through the ship. It took less than 20 minutes for the ship to sink under the waves. When the ship sunk 10-miles from the Irish coast, 1,198 of the 1,959 people on board lost their lives. Of the dead, 128 were Americans. There was an international outcry after the attack, especially from the United States, who wasn't even involved in the war at the time. 

This attack, and the 500,000 tons of vessels that other German U-boats destroyed, it was obvious that something needed to be done. The Germans first problem was when the United States got involved in the war. While this was great for Britain, things were getting bad. Their wheat stocks were dwindling, and would only last the country about two more months. Fortunately, in 1917, Norman Wilkinson had an idea. It was considered radical, but it would work. 

When World War I broke out, Norman was an amateur sailor, and he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. He was a lieutenant commander, and then became a captain of an 80-foot minesweeping vessel. 

After being on leave for a couple of days, he had an idea regarding camouflaging ships at sea. He says that the idea came to him when he was sitting in a railway carriage when black and white came to his mind. He wasn't the only one trying to find a way to camouflage the ships. Artists and inventors were also working on ideas. One person suggested cloaking the ships in mirrors. Thomas Edison suggested making the boats look like islands, complete with trees. They even tried it with one ship, but when it sailed into New York Harbor, the disguise fell apart. 

Norman's idea was crazy. His method didn't try to hide the ship. It actually made the ship stand out like a sore thumb. His plan was to confuse the enemy. Since you couldn't paint a ship to be hidden, why not do the extreme opposite? By painting the ship black and white and breaking up its form, the enemy wouldn't be able to figure out what course it was on. His idea was accepted, and he was told to go with it. 

Norman was given empty studios at London's Royal Academy of Art, and he was given a staff of 19 artists, model makers, and art students. They worked on the patterns for the ships, and each was different. If the enemy didn't know what they were looking at, they couldn't attack. 

They created a design on a ship to test it out, and it worked. More and more ships were camouflaged this way to protect them at sea. Norman's idea made him famous among Navy officials. Whether it genuinely worked during the war is unknown as there are two different theories; however, to this days, ships are still be dazzled for camouflage. The WWI camouflage strategy that was so bizarre it was actually genius is still being used today. Considering all of the work it takes, it must have been effective for the Navy to still use the camouflage today.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Imran Khan was sworn in as Pakistan‚Äôs new prime minister on August 18, but he is no ordinary politician. Before rising to power, he was a dashing cricket superstar. He lead the Pakistani cricket team to victory in the 1992 World Cup against England and became a global celebrity. He settled in England, where his popularity grew and where he was known as a bachelor.

He eventually resettled in Pakistan, where he shed his lady‚Äôs-man image and established the political career that lead him to become the head of Pakistan‚Äôs government. His strong anti-corruption message and opposition to the political dynasties that have ruled Pakistan for decades helped him ascend to power. But many have accused him of also getting help from Pakistan‚Äôs most powerful authority: the military. As Khan starts his tenure, we explore his rise to power and how Pakistan‚Äôs political climate might affect his term as prime minister.

It tastes like poo, I loathed drinking it, so I asked her why I had to drink it. She said it would keep diseases away. I now know it was Rickets she was talking about.
The thing is........ We lived in central Australia. No real shortage of sun.......
I'm gonna call my Mum.","I love how you take a vacation in completely other countries. You make it entertaining and educational for your fans
Also how the video was edited","Columbus: I finally discovered America!!! 
Viking: *Yes son you did it!!!*",Your videos have always been interesting but lately the cinematography has just been breathtaking. It's like watching the old discovery channel documentaries I loved so much as a kid. Keep up the great work!,"""I would argue that the scientific method is the greatest technology humans have ever developed. It allows us to understand not only what works, but why it works. And with that knowledge, our future is determined not by luck, but by our ability to manipulate reality to our advantage.""

Wow, that's a really powerful way to end a video!",Fun fact: in Danish Ricketts is actually called English sickness,"*Title change*
Definitely said ‚ÄúHow Cod Saved The Vikings‚Äù 
While I was at work
I want my award","Sorry, but Christopher Columbus never set foot in North America.","The Vikings suffered many hardships living in the north of Europe: long, cold winters and importantly a lack of sunlight. Luckily, they had cod.
Check out Vitamania: https://ve42.co/cod

When making a video about vitamins I thought the story would mainly be about supplement pills, whether we should or shouldn't take them and how they're made. But what I found out is vitamins have a remarkable story that affects many more aspects of our lives. For example the Vikings needed a source of vitamin D to last the dark winter months and for their children to develop strong, healthy bones, avoiding rickets.

The real culprit of removing the seasoning during cleaning is harsh scrubbing.","Um, actually you can wash cast iron with soap. Lodge's website says: ""Soap isn‚Äôt always necessary, but if you like, a little mild detergent is fine. Promise. Stay away from dishwashers and metal scouring pads, which can harm the seasoning.""","Um, actually, in star trek, it's not that france has become english, but that english became the overwhelmingly predominant language on Earth after the chaos, warfare, and rebuilding that took place in the early 21st century. Throughout the rest of the Franchise we see multiple examples that all humans seem to be able to communicate in English without the benefit of a universal translator. People from the different regions of Earth are still shown to speak with an accent specific to their area (all the french people do french accents and Dr. Bashir's parents in DS9 have accents), with the notable exception of Jean Luc Picard. Out of cannon, his character was originally going to have a french accent, but it sounded so ridiculous that the idea was scrapped early in production. Patrick Stewart has, at a couple of cons, done the into monologue (""...these are the voyages..."") with a heavy french accent and it is freaking hilarious.",Omg Zach looks so hot nowüòçüòç,"SIGN UP FOR DROPOUT: https://bit.ly/2y0lpjQ

Nobody wants to spend their life rotting away in prison. There's a very easy way to ensure that this won't happen to you: don't commit crimes. But there seem to be some people out there who can't help themselves. So, if you can't stop yourself from getting caught committing crimes, the only way to ensure that you're not locked away forever is to break out of prison.

Back to these prison escapes. While maximum-security prison breakouts are rare, this video will show you that it is in fact possible to dupe even the sharpest of guards. A dozen inmates at the Walker County Jail in Alabama used peanut butter to trick their way out of their cells. While you might be thinking that that's impossible, the way that they executed their plan was almost juvenile. Then there were two Chicago convicts who rappelled down the side of their prison building with a rope that they fashioned out of stockpiled bed sheets and dental floss. Yup, you read that right: dental floss. But perhaps one of the most perplexing prison breaks ever was that of Redoine Faid in the summer of 2018. Armed men used smoke distractions and power tools to break into his prison, and they ushered him out via a hijacked helicopter. If you're wondering why Redoine's escape sounds like something from out of a movie, it's because his life of crime is fully inspired by Hollywood movies. He's even said that if we want to diminish crime by 50 percent, we'd need to stop making movies about crime. Criminals have used all sorts of different techniques to escape from prison, and while some of them have succeeded, they don't usually last out in the world very long. All of the prisoners that we've just mentioned were recaptured soon after their escape. It seems that staying undetected after escaping is a lot harder than the escaping itself.

Let's hope for Hopper,"Hopper was specifically referred to as ‚ÄòThe American‚Äô by the Russians before the post-credit scene, so I believe he is still alive. We also didn‚Äôt see his corpse.","It's 100% hopper, they purposely showed the explosion and the death of the Russians without showing hoppers demise and no way would they do that to one of the shows major characters.","So, this is my theory:
When Joyce is about to close the gate, Hopper looks in a really doubtful way at the portal, and I suppose these are his thoughts: I can stay here and face certain death or jump in the portal and see what happens; he has definitely gone for the second. So he‚Äôs been in the other world for a long while, and when he spotted the portal that Russians opened, he went in; then Russians took him, and probably didn‚Äôt sacrifice him due to his experience in the other world. Comment below and tell me if you think the way I do as well.",I'm probably that 1% that is also emotionally wrecked because of how Billy died and apologized to Maxüò≠üò≠,"I think its hopper 
Because we never saw him die..",This means the Demagorgon isn‚Äôt controlled by the Mind Flayer.,"If you've watched the Stranger Things Season 3 finale, check out our spoiler-filled breakdown of the post-credits scene featuring David Griffin, Jacki Jing, and Clint Gage.

For everyone's benefit, 3.5M cells per day is what the rest of the world produces per day, combined. Yes, GF1 has doubled the planets production of lithium cells.",Verge: let's use use football fields and Boeing jets instead of normal units of measurement,"There's a great quote that this video reminded me about - ""People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it""",Tesla Helicopter at 5:35?,6:00 when there‚Äôs a Toyota vehicle in a Tesla video üòÇ,0:34 some horsepower outside the factory lol,"I'd gladly buy Tesla merchandise such as a cap, until I can afford an electric car. At least I can advertise what the car industry future should be.",Tesla is the next Amazon Google Netflix. In a few years in will dominate the technology industry. Other auto industry better step up their game or they will be extinct like Blockbuster videos Sears Kmart etc,"No matter how much they try to drag down this concept(and we all know who), this is the FUTURE.","Elon Musk's Gigafactory is arguably the most important thing that Tesla makes. The 1.9 million-square-foot factory in Sparks, Nevada, is only 30 percent complete, but it‚Äôs already on track to make 60 percent of the world‚Äôs lithium ion batteries ‚Äî and Tesla plans to build more Gigafactories around the world.

Some employees say CEO Elizabeth Holmes didn't want to hear criticism or too many questions. ""Not a lot of camaraderie. A lot of paranoia,"" said Justin Maxwell, Theranos' former design director.

Ex-Theranos employees describe culture of secrecy at Elizabeth Holmes' startup: ‚ÄòThe Dropout‚Äô podcast ep. 1

Not so long ago, Elizabeth Holmes was Silicon Valley‚Äôs rising star. Like so many of the most successful entrepreneurs before her, she dropped out of college to start a company. But unlike many others, her startup would go on to be valued at almost $10 billion making her the world‚Äôs youngest self-made female billionaire.

The company was called Theranos, a combination of the words ‚Äútherapy‚Äù and ‚Äúdiagnosis.‚Äù It was praised for being revolutionary and for creating a breakthrough that would change the medical industry forever.

Her board of directors was a who‚Äôs who of government heavyweights that at a time included former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Secretaries of Defense Gen. James Mattis and William Perry and former U.S. Senators Bill Frist and Sam Nunn.

Investments came from some of the wealthiest and most connected people in the world, like media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family, the DeVos family and even the Kraft family behind the New England Patriots.

But it all came crashing down. Today, Holmes is facing up to 20 years in prison and awaiting a criminal trial for charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which she has pleaded not guilty.

This was during the peak of the 'convertible' craze before pull-aparts and Yogas really took over the market.  Obviously, Dell didn't release it as a gaming laptop (that is their alienware branding),  but that is kind of my point.  This is not revolutionary, and is wholly unnecessary for any device that is to function as a ""gaming rig"".  I've been waiting for this style of laptops to make a comback since Sony discontinued making convertibles (and computers in general); I would like to get the design in a slimmer form and more middle-ground specs for simply traveling and maybe running an emulator or playing browser games.  None of this trying to run Crysis on a two-fan microbox crap.","Gaming laptops are usually stacked with crazy specs, and now Acer is stepping up the game with a device that can flip and fold.

Subscribe for more amazing videos! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ‚óÑ

Oprah is a household name that is known the world over. She's best-known for being the host of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" which ran for 25 seasons, but she's so much more than just a TV host. Actress, investor, business owner, and philanthropist are just a few of the other hats that this billionaire wears. She first became a billionaire back in 2003, which is a moment that made history due to her becoming the first female black billionaire in the USA. Today, Oprah has an estimated net worth of $3 billion. That's a lot of money for a single person to own, but Oprah does a lot of good with her billions. Besides running Harpo Productions, O Magazine, and Oprah.com‚Äîjust to name a few of her ventures, she also started her own TV network a few years ago: OWN. She even helped to revive Weight Watchers after she invested nearly $44 million and became a spokesperson for the weight loss company. She did sell some of her stocks, but her initial investment reportedly grew over $400 million. It's clear that Oprah has the Midas touch, and there's actually a term that can be used to describe the effect that she has on businesses: the Oprah effect. It basically means that whenever Oprah endorses something, whether it be a product or a book, everybody goes out to buy it the next day. This is the reason why her book club was known for turning little-known books into best-sellers. And the Oprah effect doesn't just extend to products, it also changes lives. The greatest thing that Oprah has invested her money into is her Leadership Academy for Girls in Africa. This boarding school accepts girls from impoverished areas and gives them access to an education that would not have been possible without Oprah. If you want to know exactly how this media mogul spends her billions, make sure to check out this video.

ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS FIRST POSTED ON TWITTER!",Who else was watching for the stalker after he talked about it üòÇüòÇ like if u did the same,Lance if he follows you again you should get out your car then recorded his number plate so the police can track him down Like so lance can see,Im prettty sure that guy didnt walk into the store with that mask on. Sooo if you go back to the store and let them know whats going on snd show them im sure they can go to their cameras and see what the guy looks like before he put the mask on somewhere by you. Also so this guy is slippin there are several ways that any dective can figure out who this person is. The car... The video in the store his hight his eye color all on the video footage. If you are that concerned you would show the cops and this guy would be in big trouble stalking is a serious crime also vandalism.,I think theo knows that man because he would absolutely freak out being held by someone he doesn‚Äôt know.,Theo is super calm for being with a ‚Äústranger‚Äù lol,Ok I can solve ur problem right now. Go to the store where the guy was watching u and notify them. They will check security cameras and get the dudes license plate. Next go to the police station and tell them and they can have police on patrol around your neighborhood 24/7. If u don‚Äôt do any of this then I call bs,OMG I SAW THE PERSON!!! I FEEL SO BAD!!!!

There are few things scarier than an attack from a wild animal. We know many of you aren‚Äôt concerned with such an event for the good reason that you don‚Äôt leave the city. But for people like us who enjoy the great outdoors, there‚Äôs always a possibility of encountering wild animals, and dangerous ones at that. Wild animals that can do damage with little effort. For this reason, it‚Äôs imperative to know how to act in a confrontation with an aggressive animal. This knowledge can save your life, and it applies to nearly all species. Of course, animals, by nature, are unpredictable, so the following methods may not work in every instance. Thus, it‚Äôs more important to know how to prevent an attack so that you never have to fight for your life against a bear, cougar, or moose‚Äîwhich is information you will also find in this video.

You have to use oil based enamel.",she missed the opportunity to call this video Jenna Marbles Water Marbles üòî,"Obviously... the main problem with my hydro dipped pair of crocs is that they are just too cool to even exist I'm kidding we for some reason picked up acrylic spray paint instead of regular spray paint, although I'm not 100% sure if regular spray paint would work better or worse, probably just differently or at least not crack and flake off as easily.  But yes I wound up with just essentially painted crocs WHICH IS STILL BADASS AND YES I LEAVE AN ART TRAIL WHEREVER I GO.  But will probably eventually flake off entirely even with the layer of sealant.  I would definitely recommend this form of fun having however!  I had a 10/10 time doing it and although I would have liked to have had a beautiful long lasting pair of crocs to wear, I think I might give it another go with a different type of paint and absolutely love the effect it created.  Below are the clips that I used from people (more successfully and knowledgeably) hydro dipping sneakers as well a pair of crocs that *deeply* inspired me so at least their shoes came out better than mine.  But I'm still going to wear mine anyways.  I don't really care.  I hope this inspired you to have some hydro dip fun in the future or to check out some videos on youtube because they are in fact very relaxing to watch.  Anyways I gotta go vacuum everything my feet touched.  Goodbye have a good day.

Today, on PewNews, PewNews newscaster Poppy Harlow/Michael Bay stated they were in a relationship with Marzia. Marzia is, of course, engaged to Felix, better known as Pewdiepie.

Many sources are speculating that Poppy Harlow and Marzia met at a company event, as PewNews is hosted on Pewdiepie's online platform.

When asked to confirm or deny any relationship with Marzia, Poppy Harlow stated: ""I am not supposed to say my own opinion.""

We reached out to Pewdiepie, but he was unavailable for comment. PewNews, it seems, is one of the few remaining reputable news sources able to seperate editorial opinions from facts, even regarding their employees and alleged CEO.

For more on the latest YouTube drama gossip and other poorly substantiated claims of insignificant significance, subscribe to Monogon.com for regular updates on whether Pewds is a secret lizard-robot person.","*Is Pewdiepie cheating on Marzia with Poppy Harlow?*
More on this story in Polygon.","I would be perfectly fine with the Alex Jones ban if other equally controversial figures were banned. If YouTube wants to ban controversial creators, the Paul brothers should have been gone a long time ago.",Talks about Alex Jones.

p0ZVztROpls,nonclickbait,1166,"Hello! A few things: 
1. I changed the title of this video from ""The Lions Roar"" to ""Your Attention."" Why? I don't know. Rosianna and Sarah both liked it better. 
2. Both pronunciations of gif are correct. 
3. Many of you have expressed similar concerns to the ones I talk about in this video, but many of you also have said that you've built spaces on the social internet that are carefully curated and do not occupy too much space in your life. I want to be like this latter group of people, so I am reading their comments to learn from them. 
4. I do think, even if it's a bit utopian, that the social Internet can be (and has often been) a force for good in the world. 
5. Many of you have pointed out that the comments here in nerdfighteria have always been pretty good, and that is mostly true, aside from a bad period in 2015/2016 that was mostly caused by YouTube's comment ranking system. We have been very lucky, and I hope this is--and remains--a place you feel deserves your attention, and a place that feels nourishing and encouraging. -John","I personally like to pronounce GIF as ""GIF"". The people who pronounce it as ""GIF"" confuse me since it makes absolutely no sense to pronounce it that way. And don't even get me started on the people who say ""GIF"". They send shivers down my spine.",You could say... it‚Äôs backlash... all the way down... üëÄ,"""If we refuse to roar on cue they will notice and they will change""",The lion metaphor was scary because it brought so many things into perspective tbh,"""Your attention is powerful. And it is yours.""","Trash Yahoo answers all you want, but YouTube comments have never given me the answers to my homework","Views and attention are (now literally) money. Be careful where you spend it and how much you are sacrificing to spend it. This is some of the most powerful and intelligent discourse surrounding the internet today. Thank you, Nerdfighteria for consistently making me feel like I am investing in a good thing. DFTBA
Best wishes,
Paulina","I will roar for kindness. Until I am voiceless, I will roar so that algorithms, advertisers, and social media corporations know that kindness is what I value.

DFTBA.",The idea that we own our attention is liberating. The only thing you truly own is your mind.,"In which John discusses what's wrong with the Internet, whether it's new, and the power (and value) of our attention. 
Samuel Ashworth quote is from this great essay: http://therumpus.net/2017/08/dispatches-from-the-swamp-storms-coming/
And special thanks to http://youtube.com/rosianna for thinking through this video with me.

That's why we're excited to have paired contemporary and classical poems with award-winning animators to help us all better understand the most inexplicable parts of life. 

Today, we published six poems in our new series ""There's a Poem for That"". We hope you love these poems as much as we do! Check out the whole series here:http://bit.ly/TEDEdTheresAPoemForThat 

Let us know in the comments which poems you'd love to see animated as part of this series.","Everyone sees this as motivational, but in reality, Robert Frost wrote it as a jibe towards an indecisive friend who would go on walks down one path but regret not going down the other. 

It shows in the poem with how the traveler realizes that the other path has been worn about the same as the one he didn't go down, and that he wishes to go back to that fork and take the other road yet doubts that he ever will. 

It's honestly depressing: the true meaning of the poem. The friend for whom Frost wrote it for made the same mistake of thinking it motivational, joined the army, and died.","I read it in my 9th standard.
But the animation made it magical",This was one of my favouritest poems from school - always take the one less travelled by.,"Is there a STAY here after reading some THEORIES?

OiND50qfCek,nonclickbait,170,"well, since I'm probably among the earliest and this comment probably has higher chance of being read, I'd like to say thanks to John and the Crash Course crew. Crash Course has been a major part of my information diet for the last 3 years.
This newest course is a badly needed addition to the public awareness, especially nowadays. Even though being an IT professional, I was heavily involved in teaching debate and media literacy in my earlier years. This course so far has been much much more comprehensive than I had ever been able to deliver to my fellow students.
Best wishes for all of you.
From a Vietnamese in Finland.","If I learn anything from this CC, it's *LATERAL READING*","Yet another excellent, thought-provoking, informative installment. This series has become one of my most anticipated playlists. Thanks again for the important work your channel does for us all.","When I worked for cosmetic brands, you'll get a lot of ""9/10 women found their skin was better after this product"" that would have a cross beside that, and in tiny tiny tiny letters (TINY) on the giant poster would be ""36 women were tested"" and when you look further into it -- all of them were either workers for the cosmetic brand, or loyal brand users who refuse to use any other brand. Also, 36 women is a tiny sample.","As soon as John said ""9 out of 10 crash course employees"" I immediately yelled ""STAN!""","Learning to interpret data should be required in public schools, especially in the digital age. It needs to go hand-in-hand with teaching critical thinking. Unfortunately, often in the US  critical thinking isn't just ignored, but viewed with hostility.","""She does watch a lot of tennis""

Is there data on this?","As a graphic designer, this episode is going to help me be much more aware of potentially misleading messages in the infographics I create. I wish that this topic had been present in the (albeit basic) infographics training I received - especially considering how much can apparently be covered in 13 minutes! Thank you for another great episode.","I was checking out the polls during the last election and was surprised to see in small print at the bottom of the polls the actual number of people polled. It was always below 200, and this was supposed to reflect the entire country! Yikes, really changed how I look at polls","Oh man! I have a big research paper coming up and I simply can't wait to be able to make an awesome paper with all of these tips and tricks to find good, reliable information!","Today, we're going to discuss how numbers, like statistics, and visual representations like charts and infographics can be used to help us better understand the world or profoundly deceive. Data is a really powerful form of evidence because it can be absorbed quickly and easily, but neither data, nor interpretations of it, are neutral, so today we're going to discuss how to think critically about the statistics we encounter in everyday life.

At this point, you might not think that things in North Korea can get any more ridiculous. You know that the people of North Korea venerate their past and present leaders, but did you know that they believe some crazy ‚Äúfacts‚Äù about them? We will explore some of the strangest myths around Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un. You likely know that North Korea has struggled with feeding its people for a long time, but did you know that Kim Jong-il claims to have invented the hamburger? If no ground beef is available, he also suggested that people chew on sawdust which he claimed had nutritional benefits. We‚Äôll stick with the burger, thanks. Kim Jong-un was apparently a child prodigy, capable of operating a motor vehicle at the age of only three. Meanwhile, his father was an accomplished golfer, who got a score so good on his first game that he decided to retire completely.

Whether you believe in curses or not, it‚Äôs fair to say that there are haunted objects that are inflicting some pretty horrible consequences on the people who dare to touch them. In some cases, these people have knowingly picked up the object and took it home with them, regardless of the potential curse attached. But in other cases, the poor, unsuspecting owner bought the object without knowing about its dark history. And these curses don‚Äôt always follow the rules of horror movies either: they‚Äôre not just stuck inside of creepy dolls and old, haunted boxes. Occasionally, it seems that something as unassuming as a chair can be cursed - but you wouldn‚Äôt know it until it's too late. In this video, we'll show off ten of the strangest cursed objects found all over the world. Would you risk going near any of them?

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been called the most powerful woman in the world, the liberal West's last defender, and the de facto leader of Europe. But 19 years after entering politics, she has announced she won't be running for a fifth term as chancellor and will be stepping away from politics. Her announcement comes at a pivotal time when nationalism is on the rise in Europe and the continent is still reeling from the 2015 migrant crisis. So what does Merkel stepping down mean for the future of Germany ‚Äî and for the European Union?

Just a week into 2018, Donald Trump tweeted a provocative message directed at the North Korean regime's leader, Kim Jong Un. His message cited a ""nuclear button"", and claimed that his was much larger than Kim's. But how does the U.S. protocol for launching nuclear warheads actually work? It's a process that's designed to be fast - there are only a few steps. But it's still more complicated than a simple button.

--

In 2008, two 9,000-year old skeletons were found with their bones infected by an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its effects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; and today we call it tuberculosis, or TB. TB is still one of the world‚Äôs most infectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or even HIV. How has it persisted for so long? Melvin Sanicas investigates.

Throughout his career as a drug trafficker, tunnels have been the common theme in El Chapo‚Äôs story. When he gained control of a major drug trafficking corridor in the late 1980s, Joaquin Guzman Loera ‚Äî then known as ‚Äúel Rapido‚Äù‚Äî was the first to create super tunnels for transporting drugs across the border.

At the time, a crackdown by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) meant Colombian cocaine was in decline and the Mexican narcotrafficker saw an opportunity. By using tunnels to facilitate fast transport, El Chapo leveraged his role as a trafficker to claim new responsibilities as a cultivator and distributor of drugs. 

Over the next twenty years, he learned how to use his drug tunnels in ways nobody had ever imagined and his success became dependent on his subterranean inclinations. Although his masterful use of tunnels led him to a maximum security jail cell at Altiplano prison, it would be tunnels that also led him back out again.

Like someone is trying to teach me something special, very politely.","Let's put it simple. There's no time, just motion.
Time is just human made invention to keep track of motion.","I don‚Äôt have time for this!

Wait.","""Our understanding of time starts getting complicated thanks to Einstein.""

The earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More precise time-keeping eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly are we measuring? Andrew Zimmerman Jones contemplates whether time is something that physically exists or is just in our heads.

Ideally, we want to be able to accept wins and loses the same way; with acceptance and grace. However, there are some people who are so driven to succeed and win in whatever they do. This can mean being willing to cheat, or worse, do dangerous things to reach their successes. Usually, this all means different things to various people. If it‚Äôs a competition, some might try to cut corners to try to achieve the skills that they need. This can often lead to desperate attempts to be successful - like doing things to their own body that isn‚Äôt natural. There are those who are willing to put themselves through intense social experiments just to successfully send a message to society. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself...why? Is the risk worth the end result? What if the dangerous attempt wasn‚Äôt successful at all? We‚Äôre going to meet 10 people who decided to go as far as they could to get their desired result.

We don't know everything about the Trump campaign's relationship with Russia. Nevertheless, what the public does know ‚Äî especially following this summit ‚Äî is pretty damning. 
 
We know that Russia and the Trump campaign whether publicly or privately explicitly or implicitly coordinated together and that Russia interfered in the election on Donald Trump's behalf. 
 
Ezra Klein breaks down why Donald Trump‚Äôs meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin is a remarkable, if not surreal, moment in American politics.

We all like to think we control our own autonomy. We‚Äôre in charge of making our own decisions every day - what we do, how we act, and where we spend our time. But what if the city you live in was actually controlling your behavior without you even realizing it? What if your daily routine is actually influenced by the city you're living in? From designing benches and sidewalks in specific ways to stop people from sitting around, to pushing out subtle noises to keep you from standing still, cities around the world are affecting our day-to-day activities in the sneakiest ways possible. You might already be aware of some of these methods. Perhaps some of these installments faced backlash when first introduced in your city, or maybe they‚Äôve affected you personally on your journey. Either way, the techniques in this video all work together to control your behaviour throughout your everyday life.

Around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water and soil with insects, frogs and even rats. Flies, tadpoles and beetles fall prey to the remarkable, predatory antics of carnivorous plants. What exactly are carnivorous plants and how do they trap their prey?

Martin killing off beloved characters. Shakespeare got in on the ground floor when it came to murdering his darlings!,"Huh, so even Shakespeare used the old ""Based on a true story"" tagline.","Edgar, not Edmund, is the one who disguises himself as Tom o' Bedlam. I think Edmund would be uncapable of such a feat.",you're  not my dad's ghost,"In Shakespeare's tragedies, things just get increasingly verse.","What I love about Akira Kurosawa's Ran is that it takes the story of King Lear and makes it A. Make sense. and B. Resolve every thread, for the most part. Plus it's visually one of the most beautiful films of all time.","Shakespeare's tragedies...were tragic. But they had some jokes. They also changed the way tragedies were written. Characters like Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear had tragic outcomes, but they were sympathetic characters in a lot of ways. This was a big change from the way Seneca and the Greeks wrote tragedies, and it caught on.

But I won't tell you whether it's 0 or 1 ;))))",Ooohhh this is the guy who hacked myspace right?,What kind of bourgeois gated community do you live in?,Weird house flex but ok,That‚Äôs Samy kamkar he was banned from using any computer with internet access in 3 years for hacking MySpace lol,"Or almost any garage - it's particularly good with fixed code gates and garages. Samy proposes other weaknesses with rolling codes.
This video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2oscAe9

I don't condone malicious hacking of gates, garages or other property. The point of this video was to discuss how it could be done using fairly basic technology like this toy that was originally intended as an instant messaging device. I learned a lot in making this video about how codes are sent and received, how they are encrypted or not encrypted. I found out how hard it is to execute in practice something which in principle doesn't seem that difficult.

Special thanks to Samy! His original videos on using the IM ME to open radio frequency garages and gates can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/user/s4myk
He's got a really cool channel so be sure to subscribe if you're interested in this stuff.

This is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.

M.A.G.A. HAT ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","----------------------------------------------------------
Victor Cescovo is an explorer and is also known as a daredevil. He is a Dallas, Texas native and is a scholar. He has studied at Stanford University, MIT, and Harvard Business School. He has made a name for himself as one of the founders of Insight Equity Holdings, where he has invested in defense firms and electronics. His true passion; however, is sea exploration. He has made it his life's work to go deeper into the ocean than any person in history. In April 2019, he attempted this. The dive took place in the Mariana Trench. Due to this dive, he now holds the record for the world's deepest descent. He went down 36,000-feet, which is 7,000-feet lower than Mount Everest is high. 

Victor is no stranger to the sea. He served in the United States Navy Reserve for over 20 years. After stepping down, he decided to focus on exploration. His exploration was deemed The Five Deeps Expedition. When Victor went down into the water of the Challenger Deep, which is the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean. He was going to set eyes on a place that no human being ever had. He spent four hours on the bottom of this unexplored part of the sea floor and saw something that he found incredibly shocking. 

When Victor dives to the lowest depths of the sea floor, he does hope to see things that no other human ever has. He does hope to make amazing discoveries, but he has another reason to go where no man has gone before. He wants to provide maps of the terrain of the areas that he explores. He also collects samples that will help with research in geology, geography, and biology. The lead scientist on Victor's mission, Alan Jamieson, often shares the progress on Victor's mapping. He says that so far, they have mapped out 150,000 square kilometers of the sea floor and they are only halfway done in the area. He says that when the maps are complete and cleaned up, they will be posted online for anyone to use. 

The Challenger Deep isn't just the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean; it is also the lowest point on the planet. It is a remote spot that is located in the southern end of the Mariana Trench, located about 178 miles away from dry land. The water at these depths is about 34 degrees, and it is pitch dark because the sun cannot reach this deep in the ocean. A scuba diver can go only 250-feet underwater before the pressure becomes a problem. This is why a pressurized submersible is the only way to reach these depths. Victor named his submersible, Limiting Factor, after a spaceship in one of his favorite science-fiction novels.  

On April 26, 2019, they let Limiting Factor loose. It took three and a half hours to get to the ocean floor. When an explorer had achieved the deepest ever dive when he made an alarming discovery on the seafloor. He managed to see species never encountered by humans before. Among them was an amphipod, which is similar to a shrimp. When he reached the ocean floor, he was the first human to reach a point this low at 35,853-feet. When he did, his team on the boat cheered. 

While on the sea floor, he was making his maps and observing, when he saw something that caught his eye. On the deepest part of the planet, he found a piece of garbage floating in the water. It was a piece of plastic, and Victor thought that it was either a bag or a wrapper from a piece of candy. Either way, it was man-made and somehow found its way to the deepest part of the ocean. 

When Victor saw the piece of garbage at the bottom of the ocean, he was very disappointed. He says that with over 7 billion people living on the Earth, it is only a matter of time before our oceans are destroyed if we don't do something now.  

Some of the amphipods taken from for ocean floor were taken for study. Seven in ten of them had plastic inside them. This means that the piece of plastic that Victor saw on the ocean floor wasn't the first, and it certainly won't be the last. Researchers from around the world have reported finding rubber, glass metal, under the sea. This just shows how seriously we are damaging our planet for future generations.

When you think of curses, a few host objects come to mind. Usually, it‚Äôs a person who is most often the victim of a curse, being that an individual is normally the intended destination. These cursed people are then plagued with tragic events. However, if you want to affect more people with the curse, generations of people even‚Äîall of whom are connected to the original host‚Äîthen you need to curse something that you know will come into their contact. If this is the intent, what‚Äôs a more perfect host than jewelry? Expensive, coveted, durable, and often left in wills, a piece of jewelry will come into contact with plenty of people during its lifetime. And if rich people are your target, then you'll have tons of pieces available to curse! This video shows ten jewels that brought terrible luck to their owners, which sometimes lasted over centuries.

I also think the person remembering is Mr. Chow.",Wong Kar-Wai is a poet.,I've seen this thanks to Nerdwriter & Every Frame a Painting. What a beautiful film,"Omg i have a midterm surrounding this movie in like a week, thanks",Please do on Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky) (1979).,Interesting reading about the protagonists loving the imagined versions of each other considering what happens in the events of the movie's sequel 2046.,I  never get tired of watching this movie. Thanks,Watching Wong Kar wais movies is like walking through memories you have never experienced . I watched Chung King Express and Fallen angels and they have like created a void in my heart and have sat there and they refuse to leave . But now I'm going to force myself to watch in the mood for love .,"I‚Äôm in the mood for love
Simply because you‚Äôre near me!
Funny, but when you‚Äôre near me
I‚Äôm in the mood for love.

If there are clouds above,
If it will rain, we‚Äôll let it!
But for tonight, forget it
‚ÄòCuz I‚Äôm in the mood for love.","Cinematic love stories come in all shapes and sizes. Movies are really good at both capturing and projecting emotions. And one of the best directors at the modern love story is Wong Kar-Wai. In this episode of Crash Course Film Criticism, Michael looks at Wong's film, ""In the Mood For Love"" and talks about its visual style as well as some Freudian ideas contained within.

At least it wasn‚Äôt a total loss.",People who do good deeds from there heart don‚Äôt need to come forward about what they did,I wish somebody would do that for my daughter. üòí,Why not look where the package came from,Anybody can loose their wallet&the good person returned the wallet,I've arrived early and I don't know what to comment.,"A similar experience happened to me.
In my hometown of Abbeville, South Carolina, I used to shop at the A&P Grocery store for my groceries. It was within walking distance of my home, and the prices were low. This was back in the late 1970's.


One day I shopped there and paid for my stuff and left. I had other stops on the way home to try and get things I could not find at the A&P. Well those other places did not have what I wanted either, so I went home and put my groceries away. That night I went out to a birthday party that some friends of mine were having for the wife of one of them. When I got home later, I found that my wallet was missing. There was $60+, my ID, family and friend pictures, and a few business cards from certain places I visited a lot, in that wallet. The wallet itself was a hand crafted leather wallet I had made at the local leather works shop.


Well I called the home where the party had been and asked if anybody had found my wallet. No one recalled even seeing it. I thought that perhaps one of my friends was a pickpocket, and had stolen it. Who that might be I had no idea.


Well I had to have a wallet and I needed to replace my ID and other things kept in a wallet, so I went to get a new wallet made at the leather shop after paying for a new ID, and Social Security card. I wanted to have a wallet ready for when I received the ID and Social Security card in a few weeks. I made sure that the new wallet would be suspended by a chain to my belt (also made at that leather shop), to ensure that the wallet could not be easy to lose or steal.


Life went on for me, and about a year later I moved to Griffin Georgia, where I found a better job. About two or three years later I returned to Abbeville to visit with my folks and friends there. While there I needed to get some things to contribute to a Family Reunion my family was having at nearby Parson's Mountain State Park, so I went to A&P to find what I needed. After walking the aisles and putting what I needed in my cart, I went to the registers to check out.


The manager whom I had known for a long time was looking at me in a strange way. I had to ask him what was up. I thought he might think I was shoplifting in his store. When he came and asked me to step into his office, I thought he actually was thinking I had slipped someing into my pockets from the store shelves. I just knew he was getting to cops to come and check me.


Instead he ask me what my name was, and I told him. He said "" did you lose a wallet about four years ago?""


I said ""Yes, I did!""


He opened a drawer and let me look in it, asking ""Is this it?""


I was speechless for a few moments, because there was my old wallet. He could tell I was overwhelmed and knew that my unspoken answer was ""Yes!"" He handed it to me and told me to check to see that everything was still in it. When I did, I found that even the money was still there; my ID and Social Security card, the old business cards and pictures,... everything! The old A&P in my hometown had restored my faith in humanity!


When I got back to my family and friends I told them what had happened, and they were amazed. You can bet I kept that wallet as a keepsake after that, and the money that was in it went toward helping a friend who just happened be down and out. And to top it all off, the manager donated the groceries I had in my cart to me. He said it was worth it and more for seeing my reaction to getting my old wallet back.",God Blesses those who bless others in secret.,I lost my purse a monrh a go and the man brang it to my door my house door and he told my roomatr his man to,Love your vids make more good work,"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read ProPublica reporter Ginger Thompson‚Äôs article here: https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy

And listen to the full audio clip at ProPublica‚Äôs YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoncXfYBAVI&t=70s 

In April 2018, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy on undocumented immigration. Undocumented migrants and asylum seekers detained at the border now face immediate criminal prosecution, often before their asylum claims can even be processed. Thousands of children and other migrants are now being held in detention centers operated by US Customs and Border Protection, where they await trial.

A backlash against this policy is growing, with conservatives and liberals alike decrying it as cruel and inhumane. Both the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sessions have explicitly cited the policy as a preemptive deterrent to undocumented migration, though the administration has since backtracked on that message. 

We want to help shed light on this. Has your family been separated at the US‚ÄìMexico border? Are you a worker at a detention center, or do you aid families who have been affected? Tell us more at border@propublica.org or 347-244-2134.

In our Vox+ProPublica collaboration, we create deep-dive, investigative video storytelling fueled by ProPublica's reporting. You can read the reporting at https://www.propublica.org, and watch the rest of the series on YouTube at http://bit.ly/2wfVG5Z.

Games today are meticulously detailed. They‚Äôre mysterious and heartwarming, and colorful and stylized. And that makes them a technical challenge. Though computing power has skyrocketed, gamemakers keep competing to add more detail to their games, pushing the limits of what even the newest technology can compute. Game technology needs to constantly keep up with gamemakers‚Äô creative ambitions.

Triangles are a key part of how these gorgeous, detailed games appear on your screen ‚Äî the hidden heroes we should all thank as we play. This simple shape helps keep the number of computations needed for each detail as low as possible, allowing the player's computer to process these elaborate games. 

Watch the video above to find out how triangles make room for creators to build the beautiful games that exist today.

There are plenty of stereotypes associated with cheerleaders. We often see these peppy people as ditzy, snobby, too energetic, popular, and so on. Most cities around the United States value the sport of football. And cheerleaders come hand in hand with football. You can‚Äôt have football without cheerleaders. Yet, you can have cheerleaders without football. There has been an ongoing debate in regards to whether cheerleading is a sport. Cheerleading has evolved so much, and there are definitely physical demands in cheerleading that go beyond just being loud and shaking pom poms. As with any sport, there is sure to be some controversy among the players. There are some cheerleaders who gain international attention for their talent. But there are others who get attention for reasons that go beyond their moves. Whether it‚Äôs because they were kicked off the cheer team, got in trouble, or made some sassy faces, this video will show you the cheerleaders who got noticed for all the wrong reasons!

Some places around the world need more protection than others. This could be for reasons of national security, for the preservation of a culture, for the protection of a very important person, or for various other reasons. Places are also sometimes heavily protected thanks to natural causes. Would you dare to step foot on an island that was full of the deadliest snakes in the world? While there's not much to protect on Snake Island, that doesn't stop slithering vipers from fiercely guarding it. On a more serious note, the Pentagon is one of the most secure buildings in the world. Not only was it targeted during the 9/11 attacks, but the Russians also had their eyes on it during the Cold War. Unsurprisingly, the CIA Headquarters and Trump's Air Force One are also heavily guarded. But you'll have to watch the video if you want to know what makes the CIA Headquarters‚Äô Starbucks so special.

Good for them.,Wow I actually know about Pompeii because I actually had a study in second grade for third grade I can't remember but I still have a book from it from third grade and I still have the poster,"----------------------------------------------------------
Luciano Faggiano is a Leece resident. He owned property, and he wanted to turn the ground floor into a restaurant. He along with his wife, Anna Maria Sano and his son, Davide, who was 12-years-old at the time, were going to live on the upper levels of the building. His two older sons, Marco and Andrea, had moved out of the house and gone to college. When Luciano decided that it was time to start the renovations, he asked his sons to come home to help. 

The property seemed to be in pretty good condition. Luciano realized that he would need to remodel the inside for aesthetics, but as far as the structure went, it had recently been updated. There was a new central heating system in the building, and the walls were painted bright white. Luciano decided that the property didn't need too much work, except for the toilet that was broken. 

The last thing that Luciano wanted to do was repair a backed up sewer system, but he had no choice. He got his sons together to help him dig the trench. He assumed that the project would take just a week. When they started digging, they discovered that there was a false floor in the basement. Luciano realized the job would now take longer than a week. He and his sons started digging up the false floor, keeping it a secret from his wife. 

As the men were digging, they uncovered medieval stone. This was when they realized that there could be some historical artifacts hidden under the family home. They found an uncovered grain storage chamber, which led them to believe that there was something more in there. Unfortunately, there wasn't much room to move under the floor, so Luciano asked his son, Davide, who was just 12-years-old and smaller than his other son, to search the uncovered spaces below.  

Luciano's wife started getting suspicious about what the men were doing because of all the laundry the men were putting in the hamper. His neighbors also started getting suspicious because of all the debris that was coming out of the home. When one of Luciano's neighbors alerted the authorities, they told him that the project had to end. The authorities told him that he could fix the broken pipe, but nothing more. Finally, a year later, Luciano was given the green light to start working on the project again. 

Luciano and his sons eventually uncovered ancient vases, medieval-era relics, and religious bottles. Much of the city's history was buried right underneath the Faggiano home. Each day of digging turned up new artifacts. 

The project ended up costing Luciano more money than he had so he wanted to stop. He bought cinder blocks to cover up the hole and forget about it, but the city officials didn't want him to. They wanted to see what else was down there. Also, his architect told him that he should get the sludge beneath the bathroom before renovating it. 

Luciano decided that he would drop the plans for the restaurant. Instead, he was going to build a museum called Museum Faggiano. He was going to display everything that he and his sons had found for the world to see. Fortunately, the city government was on board with the project. 

Today, the museum is one of Leece's top-rated museums. Guests can take a winding staircase to get to the area that the family had dug up. They installed bright lights and glass flooring sections so that visitors can get a good look at what is down below. Luciano says that he cannot believe that a broken pipe in the toilet started it all. It may not be Pompeii, but it is pretty great. When an Italian guy went to repair his toilet, he unearthed an ancient underground complex that changed his life.

3nB1Ntku06w,nonclickbait,324,She‚Äôs a great host.,"I love your videos very much. But with respect to magnetism, how is it even possible NOT to mention James Clark Maxwell? Almost everything we do as EEs use his equations to predict, model, and improve our designs. He was one of the most influential people in EE of all time. Without his work, we would likely still be living with 1800s technology as our mainstay. His (and Lenz, et al.) equations are what made telegraph, radio, microwave (the magnetron likely would have been years later if not for Maxwell (i.e., cold lunch)), television (let alone a modern day computer with a CPU containing BILLIONS of transistors), and just about every thing else possible to conceive through the mathematical modeling of magnetism. As an example, just look at how much trouble we would be in if PCB layout was done based solely upon autoroute. Nothing with frequencies even near the 1Ghz range would ever work (no PCs, no cell phones, etc.). J.C. Maxwell saves the day! He was able to make the mathematical correlation of so many different disciplines of physics, and quantize the charge carrier (because everything is somehow connected in the end! (Isaac Newton actually said that)) between Gauss, Lenz, Faraday, Ampere, and so many others. His work tied all of this together. His equations not only provide for EE, they are used in quantum mechanics, as well as in orbital mechanics. Maxwell's equations are in play at CERN every day. Not just this, but even light! He explains that even light is a magnetic wave, and makes assignments for the medical field of optometry. This man was nothing short of a genius, and his legacy must be celebrated!

Thanks for making these videos!","That ship the Great Eastern was a big deal because it was the only ship big enough to do the job. As it turns out, a cable long enough to cross the ocean is quite a lot of cargo all in one place.",Goosebumps! I love CC engineering so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Whoever you are, wherever you are, I hope you have an amazing day! :)",That bookshelf bothers me.,"Oh man, the whole story over how and why Alexander Graham Bell got the first patent for the telephone would make for a crazy episode all on its own.",Edison was fighting a loosing battle. Direct current simply does not have the range necessary to make it practical for large scale production and use.,Do one of these on architecture please,"To those who may scroll down here (or have already commented) to say that they missed certain prominent figures or breakthroughs that you may feel should have been mentioned in this video, there are a couple things to consider:

1) This is only the 4th in a series of videos, and at the moment we aren‚Äôt quite sure what else may be covered at a later date.

2) It‚Äôs also possible that the event or figure was covered in an episode of a different series, as is the case with James Clark Maxwell and his equations being mentioned in their series on physics, in which case it doesn‚Äôt make sense to spend too much unnecessary time on it here. 

3) As others have said, many of the specific figures people have mentioned aren‚Äôt engineers at all, but rather scientists or mathematicians. While it‚Äôs still crucial to give due credit to *all* those who helped bring about these advances in engineering, the purpose of this series is to highlight the engineers themselves, as well as their creations. 

That said, I do love seeing the discussions in the comments about these figures and their contributions to not only these respective fields of engineering, but to engineering and science as a whole. It‚Äôs genuinely amazing to see how the influence of many individuals can create these innovations as each person builds on the foundation laid by the last, and especially to see the underlying framework laid out by some of the lesser known, but equally important, contributors.","Next stop on our tour of engineering‚Äôs major fields: electrical engineering. In this episode we‚Äôll explore the history of telecommunications, electric power and lighting, and computers. We‚Äôll introduce topics like magnetism, electrical conduction, telegraphy, lighting, and computers.

Love the fact I can literally leave my phone at home and pay with my watch.,"I got this watch, it's garbage. Had to send it back 4 times because it wouldn't hold its charge after a product updates.

Great review.,1,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch may resemble a traditional timepiece, but what lies inside is anything but traditional. The new smartwatch doubles down on trackers for sleep, fitness and stress, while keeping old Samsung Watch favorites like the interactive, rotating bezel. There are still some kinks to work out, but if you're not too particular about your apps, then this watch might be the perfect fit.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",Please write a book about you and Sarah's two-person book club!,"For anyone wondering about the library involvement, I wanted to share this from Twitter:
Me: So we can join without buying a subscription, if we just want to get books from the library? How do we get access to the Discord? (I‚Äôd feel bad using the provided resources if I‚Äôm not paying. üòñ)
John: Don't feel bad; it's meant to be inclusive. You'll get access to the discord via the Life's Library site. You won't get the podcast/discussion guide/etc., but you'll still be part of the club and conversations about the book.
So THANK YOU for that! I'm really excited to participate. :')","My body has never been so overwhelmed as I rapidly tried to both watch and absorb the video, and simultaneously enter my email address. Needless to say, i'm so excited for this. I've been part of this community for 7 years, and have never actually encountered another nerdfighter in the real universe of 3D people, so i'm looking forward to reading and discussing with a community.","AART is the October book for my local Nerdfighter book club in Victoria, BC. We are called Victorians in my Pants.","John! I have it on good authority (aka my fianc√© who is a librarian who processes questions) that the Chicago Public Library had a surge in requests for If You Come Softly, as well as numerous people who are restarting lapsed library accounts to get the book. my partner was baffled as to why this happened for this specific book on this specific day, but he heard me listening to this video and made the connection. 

regardless of what else comes out of Life‚Äôs Library, know you got a bunch of Chicago Nerdfighters very excited to use their local library and read a new book.","Something I feel bad about a lot is I don't feel like I'm a very good reader. I read a lot, but whenever anyone talks about symbolism or other such devices I feel like I never notice them or only notice them in a way that would be help in writing like an 11th grade essay about them (which I guess is the last time I needed this skill). I hope that joining this allows me to learn how to read in a more fulfilling and thought-provoking way.","Even after seeing the pinned comment from John, just he SERIOUSLY underestimated the interest of Nerdfightera",Some of the best books I‚Äôve read were in book clubs. Including Paper Towns in my high school book club. I‚Äôm excited to be able to read books I‚Äôve never heard of and connect with others. I think this is just what I need right now.,"What if we‚Äôre, say, in college and therefore our address will change before the year is over? Is there going to be an option to change the address for a physical subscription?","Life's Library, a new kind of book club: http://lifeslibrarybookclub.com

In which John announces the project he and Rosianna Halse Rojas have been working on, Life's Library. Here's the idea: Every six weeks for a year, a group of people read a book together, and discuss it on a discord channel. You can choose either a physical subscription--in which you get the book, a letter from me, bookplates made by artists we love, and other cool surprises--or a digital subscription--in which you pick up your own copy of the book and get all the other resources emailed to you. 100% of profits will go to Partners in Health. We don't yet know if there will be enough interest in this idea to make it work, so we aren't launching yet. But if you want to reserve your spot for if/when we do launch, you can sign up now at https://store.dftba.com/collections/lifes-library-book-club by clicking on the subscription you want and entering your email address at the bottom of the page. 

Fans of An Absolutely Remarkable Thing: https://discord.gg/X97RQDu

Let us know if you have any questions. Here's to reading great book together!

Most of us share a similar opinion of this man. As well as being known for his delicious recipes, he's mostly thought to have a vocabulary and patience as spicy as his meals. And while he might be one of the most successful chefs of our time, there's plenty more about this British chef, restaurateur, writer, television personality, and food critic than you might have once thought. 

But, like all of the best celebrities, Gordon's doing a lot of good with his fame, too. From launching his own charity initiative with his wife to taking it easy on teaching the chefs of tomorrow's world, Gordon Ramsay's real personality shines through when you dig deeper through the cracks of that tough exterior.

A bunch of rich people are upset that the ""peasants"" are wearing the same clothes as them. As long as the product is clearly not ""the original"", then I see no issue with it. The only reason why people buy Gucci, Prada, Tory Burch, etc is for the label. It's for the clout and the ""image"" that those labels bring. Fashion companies already have protection over their labels. What they choose to put those labels on should NOT be copyrighted unless it is a unique avant garde piece that is one of a kind or not mass produced.

Allbirds says Steve Madden copied their sneakers. Gucci says Forever 21 ripped off their green-red-green stripes. Adidas says Zara knocked off their Yeezys. 

In the Constitution, Congress has the power to stop copying by giving authors and inventors ‚Äúthe exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.‚Äù 

But there‚Äôs a catch. These protections must ‚Äúpromote the progress‚Äù of creative industries. 

Conventional wisdom holds that copying kills innovation and hurts industry progress. But within the fashion industry, experts like New York University law professor Christopher Sprigman say the ease of copying is actually good for creativity.

In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish swims up to 110 kilometers per hour. These feats are made possible by a fish‚Äôs form -- which in most species is a smooth, long body, fins, and a tail. Lauren Sallan explains why these features are so common, and what it reveals about fish.

So the Video Lab is a membership program we set up so that viewers could support our work directly.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

This is an updated version of a video we published in 2016 about the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration to image a black hole for the first time in human history. 

On April 10, 2019, the team announced their results: They had successfully imaged the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy m87, which is nearly 54 million light-years away from us. They were able to achieve unprecedented resolution using very long baseline interferometry, which combines the observations of multiple radio telescopes across the globe. 

The team wanted to find out whether Einstein's Theory of General Relativity holds up in the extreme environment of black holes, and the results do, in fact, seem to be consistent with the predictions. In the future, we may see more and shaper images of black holes as the team targets smaller wavelengths of light and recruits more telescopes. Eventually, they may include an orbiting space telescope.

It‚Äôs a busy time for the British royal family as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle prepare to tie the knot. And like any guest in attendance of a wedding, you‚Äôll need to dress for the occasion. And one thing that literally stands out at British royal weddings are the hats and fascinators adorning guests‚Äô noggins. 

While hats have fallen out of style for everyday fashion, they have remained as tradition at fancy shindigs like royal weddings, horse races, and other British formal occasions.

Subscribe for more amazing videos! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest ‚óÑ

How deep can a human being dive in the ocean? It seems like there should be a clear-cut answer. After all, the human body has its limits. We know that we don‚Äôt do very well when we‚Äôre lit on fire, are without oxygen for long periods of time, or are exposed to the vacuum of space. But when it comes to how deep the human body can survive underwater in full diving gear, the answer is less clear. And that‚Äôs because too much pressure is a little more complex than too little pressure. In this video, we‚Äôll cover why that is, how divers mitigate the biggest risks to their survival underwater, and what we know about the theoretical limits of human diving depth‚Äîbased on what‚Äôs been tried so far. Tell us what you think in the comments, especially if you‚Äôre a diver! Also, don‚Äôt forget to like, subscribe, and ring that bell so that you never miss a video from TheRichest.

The only difference is that the same tech is being baked into Google Chrome - which has to be eventually as we move into 4K and 8K video streaming, since those resolutions demand such high requirements that (reliable) cloud gaming services can become a reality as a side benefit.

My guess is that Google trying to break into the gaming/consumer market using their reach in cloud computing and internet might, with their version of PlayStation Now.

The fear stems from the fact that there were so many different devices out there. I felt overwhelmed by the idea of beginning to research each of them to determine if it was what I needed, and then to try to figure out what else I would need to make a device work.  I was convinced that I would end up buy a lot of things that sounded cool, but didn't work for me because I was missing some other thing.

Teen Titans Go! Vs. Teen Titans features the beloved multi-series cast of the past 17 years: Greg Cipes as Beast Boy, Scott Menville as Robin, Khary Payton as Cyborg, Tara Strong as Raven, and Hynden Walch as Starfire. The cast also spotlights Kevin Michael Richardson as Trigon/Hexagon, Robert Morse as Santa Claus, Grey Griffin as Mrs. Claus, Rhys Darby as Master of Games, Sean Maher as Nightwing, and four-time Grammy Award winner ""Weird Al"" Yankovic as Gentleman Ghost and Darkseid.

Drug lord Pablo Escobar smuggled four hippos into his own personal zoo during the 1980‚Äôs. But wild hippos are usually only native to Africa and their escape after Escobar‚Äôs death has left Colombia with an unexpected problem. Due to reproduction, there are now dozens roaming around one of the country‚Äôs rivers.

This episode looks at how the presence of these hippos affects Colombia‚Äôs biodiversity and how people became fond of their presence.

Diamonds might usually be a girl‚Äôs best friend but buying one of these pieces of jewelry could affect more than just your bank balance. Many necklaces or rings come steeped in history, and most of them can be traced back through a few generations of family and have some heartwarming meaning to them. But not all of them have a happy history. The jewelry we‚Äôll be showing you today is the type that you‚Äôll want to stay far away from. The owners of these pieces have found themselves suffering horrendous illnesses, tragic endings, and financial ruin. They might look good, but there‚Äôs certainly more to them than meets the eye. From beautiful crowns worn by royalty to headdresses passed on as a thank you present, these well-meaning jewels have come back to bite their owners in ways that you might never have imagined. Some might call these accidents nothing more than bad luck, but at what point does it become just too coincidental?

Animals come in various forms, shapes, and sizes.  As a society, we often forget to consider that the same animal can look completely different in another country. Animal species have been known to evolve in order to adapt to different environments. Dogs, cats, cows, and horses have constantly changed over the years to suit their conditions. This is why there's usually so many different breeds within a species. In this video, we‚Äôre going to show you how certain animals can look completely different from their international counterparts. We'll show you just how diverse nature can be within a single species of animal. While you may think that you already know what these common animals look like, you will be amazed to see just how bizarre their counterparts look in other countries. If you thought that all pigs were bubblegum pink in color, then you'll be shocked to see the kind of pigs that live in China.

Everyone loves going to the movies. We love being immersed in stories, and movie magic helps make that happen. But how do they complete all of those fight scenes and dangerous tricks? Does Chris Hemsworth know martial arts? Why would they let Megan Fox get so close to dangerous explosions in ""Transformers?"" Well, those types of scenes are actually filmed with stunt doubles. And if you‚Äôre going to stand in for gorgeous celebs like Tom Hardy and Priyanka Chopra, then you have to be a stunning beauty yourself. In this video, we'll look at 10 Gorgeous Stunt Doubles Who Put Actors To Shame. Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson has had the same stunt double for the last fifteen years. Even the Harry Potter films had a cast of stunt doubles to help keep their main actors safe.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

These days, pro golfers are hitting the ball far. Really far. And it's creating a problem: because modern golfers can reach the hole with fewer shots than before, older courses -- like Augusta National Golf Club, Oakmont Country Club, and others -- are becoming obsolete. Now, professional organizations, like the United States Golf Association, are struggling to find a solution for big powerful golfers like Dustin Johnson, Bubba Watson, and Tiger Woods. While the jump in distance is due to lots of factors, conversation is centering on the controversial possibility of redesigning the golf ball to reduce distance. It'd be the latest turn in the ball's long history: Golf balls have evolved from ""featheries,"" to gutties, to balata balls, and eventually dimpled modern balls. But the biggest, and most recent change? The almost-instantaneous switch from wound balls to solid core multilayer balls like the Titleist Pro V1.

Because I do not.
Feel bad for Owens, though.",So two innocent people went to jail for more than two decades because one was a greedy liar.,Owens better get MILLIONS not a couple hundred thousand.,"Screw Thompson. He got himself in the situation by criminally misleading the original investigators and implicating an innocent man for murder in order to get $1000... anyone who says he's over-punished for ""a simple lie"" and/or ""we all lie"" is extremely misguided. Think about this, if you spent two decades in prison for someone's ""simple lie"" would you feel they should be given any leeway?","Land of the free.

*terms and conditions may apply. Consulting your attorney to see if freedom is applicable to you.*","It is alarming, how the police just believes some random idiot and his incoherent story to imprison an innocent man..","Happy he is apologetic towards Owens, but what about the family of the victim? He basically robbed them of justice over $1k.",Alford-plea should be unconstitutional. You can‚Äôt on one hand be able to plea the fifth but on the other hand force someone to say something they didn‚Äôt do to for the prosecutor to get an easier trial.,"A confounding case in Baltimore shows just how far prosecutors will go to keep a win on the books. 

Check out ProPublica‚Äôs feature story on the use of the Alford plea here: https://www.propublica.org/article/what-does-an-innocent-man-have-to-do-alford-plea-guilty

In 1987 police detectives ‚Äî who‚Äôd later be made famous by David Simon, creator of ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù ‚Äî ¬†used flimsy evidence to pin a burglary, rape and murder case on James Thompson and James Owens. They were both sentenced to life in prison. Then 20 years later, DNA evidence cleared each of them of the rape and unraveled the state‚Äôs theory of the crime. But instead of exonerating the two men, prosecutors dangled the prison keys, pushing them to plead guilty to the crime in exchange for immediate freedom. What prosecutors offered was a controversial deal called an Alford plea. Last year, ProPublica investigated prosecutors‚Äô use of Alford pleas and similar deals in cases of wrongful convictions, and found they often cover up official misconduct. Check out the story of the two Jameses above to see what happened after the Alford plea was offered in their cases.

An SSD isn't just twice as fast and maybe some more. The speed of flash memory is the reason we've been seeing so many new USB standards pop up quickly after one another. Thunderbolt is basically a complete redesign, since even with all those upgrades the ""old"" USB interface could still hold an SSD back.
You'd be lucky if your HDD gets read speeds of 200 MB/s, meanwhile an SSD can easily get 3000MB/s with some even doubling that. To reach those speeds is the real reason you'd want to check your system's specs.
It's not like it's hard to find performance data from companies who are trying to sell their product....",I only added the Clarification Please playlist to my library only to watch her <3,"Don't forget that if you have any old laptops or desktop computers lying around collecting dust, you can always salvage the hard drives from those and purchase a hard drive enclosure for $5-$10 and use that as an external hard drive!","Soooo good, great video!! *clap*clap*",That was an amazing explanation.

Would‚Äôve made that segment better,Should have had the audience play too and vote,is the audience literally just watching some people play quiplash from the back?? lmao wtf,I've been playing this game for years! So surreal to see it on the Tonight Show.,I wish I got paid as much as Jimmy to play Quiplash and Pictionary.,Wow they‚Äôre actually playing quiplash lol,The audience could care less about this,Jimmy's running man dance at the end cracked me up üòÖ,‚ÄúHarry Potter and the I lost my harry pott‚Äù Wut?,I can tell that Jimmy REALLY likes this gane and may annoy his coworkers eitg it but thats cool.

Henson, Michael Che and The Roots' Tarik Trotter battle it out in a competition of Quiplash, where they have to think of funny responses to top each other.

oBh7eRM4Vmk,nonclickbait,932,If you bought Red Dead Redemption 2 just for the Online mode and never completed the story... There is actually something wrong with you.,The singleplayer is a masterpiece. The multiplayer is everything wrong with the industry right now.,Thanks for throwing the annotations in front of the review score so I couldn't see,The score was blocked by huge video thumbnail links ya‚Äô goofs.,rather have a story single player dlc that i would glady buy for $30 or $40 than play another second of dead online second job mode,Legend has it rockstar threw the RDO dev team off the cliff for the soul stone,2021 RDR2 : steam jetpack,It's a nice bonus but you definitely have to buy it for the single player.,I think 8.5 is too high. A 6/10 would make more sense. There is nothing to do but repetitive missions with friends.,I played very little of rdr2 online after i finished the story. I couldnt imagine a world without dutch vanderline or arthur morgan.,"Red Dead Online reviewed by Luke Reilly on PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X.

It you feel sad and want to talk about it, talk about it. If you feel misunderstood, talk to a doctor. If you think you're going through mental issues, please seek help man.

10 Unbelievable Things Found Deep In The Woods
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0OXFLNmSw



It‚Äôs a dangerous world out there and lurking in plain sight could be any one of these monstrous plants. So be wary, be careful and join TheRichest as we steer you to the right canopy of leaves to protect you from the wrong side of the woods. 

You may think that trees couldn‚Äôt possibly be as harmful as predatory animals lurking in the shadows of some faraway forest, but don‚Äôt get too comfortable. Even if you don‚Äôt live in some far-flung paradise full of dangerous plants, there could be a pesky piece of bark sitting quietly in your backyard, just waiting to strike. That‚Äôs why we here at TheRichest will give you the lowdown on the Bunya Pine, the Manchineel, the English Yew, the Cerbera Odollam, the Hemlock, the Sandbox tree, the Strychnine tree, the Milky Mangrove, and the Gympie Gympie. 

Don‚Äôt let their colorful names fool you! And don‚Äôt let their twisting branches and hanging fruits lull you into a false sense of security! These plants will use all their characteristics that they obtained through eons of evolution to protect themselves and their seeds. Don‚Äôt hug their trunks, touch their bark, and definitely do NOT build a treehouse inside them‚Ä¶ unless you want to tempt fate and invite havoc upon your house. But hey, if you want to risk it, join us as we take a closer look, because when you think about it, nature is pretty cool, huh?

The Verge traveled to Tampa, FL, to visit Facebook‚Äôs worst-performing content moderation site and learn about what life is like for hundreds of moderators. They told us that the office is filthy, the work is grim, and the side effects of doing the job last long after it is over.

Earlier this year, The Verge‚Äôs Casey Newton broke the story about the working conditions of Facebook moderators in Phoenix, AZ. Newton published a followup today revealing that the pattern of severe workplace conditions extends to a second campus in Tampa, FL, but in even more extreme ways.

What you will be seeing are the most unique families in the world. Before you watch, we have to let you know that unique doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean bad. It just means that they differ from regular families by a gigantic margin. This could be a bad thing or a good thing or a neutral thing ‚Äì the only constant is that you‚Äôll be surprised by the goings-on of the following families. They put your crazy cousins to shame. In this video, you‚Äôll see a family that has not 17, 18, or 19 kids, but 21. Another family has 180 biological members and operates as its own religious sect. 

All of these families and more are contained within the above video, which, if anything, should make your own weird families seem normal in comparison.

- had a signed publishing contract unexpectedly cancelled;
- been told one day I was being promoted to a higher position at a global media company, then told the next that I was being let go because that position no longer existed;
- gotten in a debilitating car wreck when I was rear ended on the Los Angeles freeway, leaving me with months of mind-cracking chronic pain;
- watched my savings dwindle in pursuit of my dreams until tumbleweeds whistled through my bank account;
- been guaranteed a screenwriting job for the president of a major studio, only to have the project (for now) disappear...

...I needed this.

It‚Äôs been a while since we talked, and longer still since we last hung out, but despite the time and distance I still feel like you often have a knack for swooping in at the vital moment to be my fairy godbrother.

Wishing you and the family hope, happiness, and health, my friend.

- Mike","I am supposed to take an exam(specifically the most competitive exam in my country) in a month, and for many reasons, I hadn't been preparing for it all this while. I was still going to study for it now but deep down, I started believing that I am not going to make it. And so I was not giving my all, setting myself up for failure. I have tears in my eyes now. Thanks John. Those last words are EXACTLY what I needed right now. I'll get my ass off YouTube. Thanks so so much ‚ù§Ô∏è","It matters not who won or lost
Nothing is the score you made
Fame is a petal that curls in the frost
But I will remember how you played.
- from Unseen Academicals, Terry Pratchett","Like Stephen Daedalus said nearly a century ago ‚ÄúEvery life is many days, day after day‚Äù (Joyce, 9.1048), and i suppose victory is like that in a way. Many small moments (like the one you described), moment after moment. Wishing AFC Wimbledon the best of luck!","In which John talks about the keys to winning in life, sports, and everything else while discussing The Walsall Event.

AFC WImbledon's survival in League One is coming down to the last couple games, and boy am I tense. But in this video I wanted to talk about how luck and support matter hugely when it comes to success, so does Barry Fuller picking up the ball and running it back to the center circle.

In 2017, the US government announced a travel ban to prevent American citizens from visiting North Korea. While there has always been tensions between the countries, it reached a new low when Otto Warmbier returned to the US in a terrible condition after being detained for nearly eighteen months in North Korea. The student sadly passed away from an unknown illness just a few days after he was released. But Otto wasn‚Äôt the only foreigner who had a bad experience in North Korea. Over the last 20 years, more than a handful of international citizens have visited the state for a variety of reasons, and many of them have had a negative experience. From being detained under made-up charges to spending their days in hard labor camps, their stories are enough to make us want to stay away from North Korea. Because in North Korea, there's no way of knowing exactly what‚Äôll happen to you if you end up on the wrong side of the law.

A male firefly emits a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a female will respond and mate with him. A female from a different species mimics his patterns: by tricking the male, she lures him in -- and turns him into a meal. Where else do we see this kind of trickery in the animal kingdom? Eldridge Adams details the surprising complexity of how animals manipulate predators, prey and their rivals.

10 Amazing Elon Musk Inventions You Probably Didn't Know About

And in order to reach super high levels of success, it‚Äôs quite likely that you‚Äôll have to develop your own specific set of rules and stick to them down to a T. Because if you don‚Äôt stick to your own resolutions, you could end up getting swayed by the opinions of others. 

And one man who‚Äôs done this maybe more than the average billionaire is Elon Musk. This technology entrepreneur and engineer hails from South Africa and has a net worth of $21.2 billion. He‚Äôs the wealthiest South African and has dipped his ink into a variety of different business ventures. 

You‚Äôll probably know him best for his work as founder, CEO, and lead designer of SpaceX or maybe for his work with TESLA. If you follow Elon on any form of social media, you'll know that he's rather eccentric. Sure, he's a great businessman and knows exactly what to do in order to make money, but he does so by sticking to his own rules through and through. Some of them make perfect logical sense, but others are more unusual. Today, we're going to be showing you some of the rules that Elon enforces on a personal level and also the ones that he insists on his employees following.

So if you're planning on getting a job at TESLA anytime soon, you'd better watch this video. We'll let you into a secret before we start this video: Elon has some very specific preferences and requirements in his day to day life. Weirdly enough, one of them relates to a certain color that he absolutely hates. #ElonMusk

Despite popular belief, a mansion is not always more valuable if it was owned by a famous person. In fact, this ownership can actually decrease the property‚Äôs value. Studies show that the house of a famous person lasts an average of 36 days longer on the market than that of a non-famous person. The reasons for this are paradoxical. It seems that the exact reasons why someone would want to buy a famous mansion are exactly what turn people off from owning said mansion: there‚Äôs too much baggage. Not only is a celebrity mansion already in the spotlight, with many people knowing its history and address, it‚Äôs usually decked out with so many personalized amenities that the place becomes an eyesore. While fans may appreciate these additives, few fans are rich enough to actually buy their favorite celebrities‚Äô shrine. Rich businessmen don‚Äôt care about the celebrities who owned the home, only the home itself. Of course, with celebrities being celebrities, they will list their homes in accordance with their popularity. Now that we know this doesn‚Äôt always help, there are many owners stuck in real estate stalemates. Perhaps they will adjust to the market...if the market doesn‚Äôt already adjust to them.

Holy shit he really is Tony Stark.","What are all the products that Elon Musk actually invented or brought to life? For starters, there's Teslaquila but I bet you don't know all 10!

Elon Musk is the co-founder and CEO of Tesla Inc.; founder, CEO, and lead designer of SpaceX; and founder of The Boring Company‚Äîamong his many other various titles. Musk wears a lot of hats, and he seems to operate best this way. While he wouldn't wish his insane work schedule upon his worst enemy, he has become a leader in innovative technologies and has brought many of his wild ideas to life. 

For example, The Boring Company was created after Musk tweeted out that he was going to make his own tunnel boring machine because he was so tired of dealing with traffic. After the tweet was sent, he realized how good of an idea that was and founded the company on the same day. Focused on building tunnels underground, The Boring Company is looking to alleviate traffic in highly-congested urban cities by putting the highways below street level. 

Then there's Teslaquila, a distilled agave liquor that Tesla submitted a trademark application for after Elon tweeted about it as a joke. We're still waiting for it to officially become a reality, but the Tesla CEO did share a picture of what the bottle is going to look like. As you can probably tell, Musk hashes out his best ideas on Twitter. But it's the fact that he's able to then bring these ideas to life that makes him stand out from the rest. Perhaps the coolest thing that he's been working on is SpaceX's Super-Heavy Starship, a reusable rocket-spaceship duo that will eventually be used to colonize Mars. While the naysayers believe that it can't be done, Elon has a plan‚Äîand a determination‚Äîthat's hard to argue with. SpaceX is already the only private company that's able to return a spacecraft from low Earth orbit, and we can't wait to see what else the company can achieve with a little help from Elon's billions.

When choosing between an Android and an iPhone, many people choose the iPhone. Android and iPhones have the same capabilities, they look very similar, and they both send calls, texts, and data. The only reason that so many people want an iPhone is the prestige they feel by holding their phone and having people see the Apple symbol on the back. Android makes phones today that are more expensive than the iPhone, but it doesn't stop people from choosing Apple. 

People are crazy when it comes to the amount of money that they are willing to spend on a cell phone. It is possible to get a good Smartphone with a large screen and all of the necessary functions for under $100. Those who love the iPhone don't want these phones. Instead, they are willing to spend over $1,000 on a cell phone. When the newest iPhone comes out, people go crazy, and they spend money that they don't have. 

In 2011, a Chinese teen wanted an iPhone so badly that he was willing to do anything. His friends had the newest iPhone, and he knew that he wasn't able to afford it on his own. His parents didn't have much money so there was no way that his family would be able to afford to buy him the phone that he wanted. When he heard that people were buying kidneys, he thought that it was a good idea. 

For the most part, kidney donation is a very safe procedure. If a person has two failing kidneys, they would need to have dialysis several times a week. They would also go on the transplant list. If a friend or family member happens to be a match for the kidney, they would be able to donate. It is possible for a person to live with just one kidney. Giving a loved one a kidney is the greatest gift in the world because you are giving them the gift of life. Before you can donate, tests are run, and the procedure is set up in a reputable, accredited hospital. The teen from China didn't understand this. 

There is no law saying that you can't donate a kidney to a friend or family member. You can even donate a kidney to a stranger. What is not allowed is selling a kidney. There are strict laws in place that make selling a kidney illegal. If you are going to donate, you cannot profit from it. The Chinese teen knew this, but he didn't care. He wanted a new iPhone, and he was willing to break the law to get one. 

Because selling an organ is illegal, the teen couldn't go to a reputable hospital to have his kidney removed. He was being offered $3,200 for his kidney, and he was told that he had to go to an underground to have the procedure performed. These hospitals are often located in abandoned warehouses. The surgical area is far from sterile, and the doctors who perform the procedures don't follow any sterile practices that are required by licensed physicians. The teen didn't know much about organ donation or the practices that doctors must follow. He wanted the iPhone, so he didn't think too much about anything else. 

The teen gave his kidney, and he received his money. It wasn't long before he started feeling sick. As the days passed, he became sicker and sicker. Finally, his parents took him to the hospital. They took him to a reputable hospital. After running some tests, the doctors discovered that he was suffering from a serious infection. The infection was the result of having surgery under unsanitary conditions. He had to tell his parents and the doctors about his illegal surgery and the money that he received to buy a new phone. 

The doctors tried to treat the infection, but it was so serious that there was nothing that they could do. The infection had spread to his remaining kidney, and there was nothing more that they could do. The had to remove his diseased kidney. This left the 17-year-old boy with no functional kidneys. He had to be placed on the transplant list and put on dialysis. He has no way of knowing if he will ever get a kidney and if he will even live to see is 18th birthday. 

The teen and his parents were devastated. He couldn't believe that he might lose his life for an iPhone. If the teen had gone to a reputable hospital and had the procedure performed by a licensed physician, he would have been just fine. Since selling kidneys is illegal, he couldn't go that route, and now his life has changed forever. His new home is a hospital room. 

Man Sells His Kidney For iPhone. Then Doctors Notice Something Horrid. His kidney had failed, he would live in a hospital bed, and he wouldn't be able to go back to school. All of this to have the newest iPhone. Had he not wanted the prestige of owning an iPhone, he could have saved for an affordable phone and his future wouldn't up in the air.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

House has become one of the most popular forms of electronic music since its inception in the late 80‚Äôs.

It began in Chicago, when local DJ‚Äôs and music producers experimented with remixing disco vocals over hard hitting drum machines. They would soon play a huge role in popularizing the sound and distinguishing house music as a global music genre. 

Chicago gospel singer, Loleatta Halloway, is one of the most widely sampled artists in house music history. Her song ‚ÄúLove Sensation‚Äù has been sampled nearly 300 times, including on Black Box‚Äôs ‚ÄúRide on Time‚Äù, the notorious hit that became the best selling single in the U.K in 1989.

No matter how long. why? There is no good reason unless they're profiting. What they're doing is so cruel and disrespectful.,ok the 11th,"A group of archaeologists is excavating a cemetery in India. The people buried in the cemetery are from the Harappan era. There are dozens of graves in the area, which shouldn't come as a big surprise. What else would you expect when excavating a burial ground. It wasn't the bodies that they found astonishing. It was something else. Archaeologists in India unearthed 4, 500-year-old skeletal remains that reveal ancient secrets. 

The team of archaeologists was excavating the Harappan site from 2013 to 2016. Some were from India's Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, which is based in the city of Pune. The other team working at the site was a group of scientists from the Institute of Forensic Science at South Korea's Seoul National University College of Medicine. 

The excavation was taking place at an area called Rakhigarhi. The people who lived there dated back to about 5,300 years ago, during the Bronze Age. Harappa was one of the largest cities in the Indus Valley Civilization.  Some of the finds at the site included terracotta blocks, statues, and jewelry. 

The Indus Valley Cities around Harappa was considered to be very advanced for its time. The cities were planned systematically. They had structured water supplies and drainage schemes set up. The houses were built with fired blocks. The people there were very skilled when it came to craftwork, such as jewelry. They typically worked with bronze, tine, copper, and semi-precious stones. 

Archaeologists found proof that the Harappans had a writing system. They found evidence of up to 600 different symbols carved into artifacts. The etchings were found on ceramic seals and vessels. Unfortunately, nobody knew what the etchings meant, so nobody was able to decipher them. It seemed to be a lost language. 

The city was advanced in its drainage system. The houses were connected to conceal the drains that ran along the city streets. They were also believed to have been used for protection against flooding. They were very smart when it came to defense, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to protect people from other things. 

When the excavation team and the archaeologists dug up the bodies, they had an idea of how this civilization died off. Many of the skeletons had apparent injuries. It is unknown whether another group attacked the city, or if the violence was internal. Injuries were not the only cause of death that the researchers found. It appeared that disease killed many of residents. Tuberculosis was one disease, but leprosy seemed to be the more prevalent cause of death due to disease. 

Scientists have been looking for the reason that the Indus River Civilization ended. There are a number of theories. One theory is that there was an invasion and a huge battle that took out many of the residents. Some experts believe that a change in the course of the Indus River may have had a drastic effect on the Harappan civilization. Some are sure that climate change caused a severe drought, that could have impacted agriculture, which could have resulted in food shortages and starvation. Finally, monsoon rains increased temperatures, and earthquakes are believed to have been to blame. 

Many archaeologists are sure that earthquakes are the cause of so many deaths. The earthquakes would have been powerful enough to destroy city structures and alter river systems. Between this and the drought, there just wasn't' enough water for everyone. 

In 2015, the dig in the area was shut down. One worker was found guilty of fashioning false invoices while working at Rakhigarhi. Secretly, the excavation continued. They found a male and a female lying facing each other, intimately, which led everyone to believe that they were lovers. They were buried with pots, which people believed were necessary for them to go to the afterlife. It is believed that they were buried together so that they could remain together after death. This is proof that thousands of years ago, romance existed. The archaeologists who found the grave began calling the two occupants, the Valdaro Lovers. The woman showed obvious signs of a head injury, but the cause of death for the male is unknown. There are some people who don't believe that the couple was even male and female. Due to the decay of the bones over time, some say that it is hard to tell. Those who are true romantics believe that the couple was a male and female based on the way that they were buried together. The woman appeared to be resting her head on the male's shoulder, close to his head. The archaeologists who believe that the two are male and female are sure that the couple was once in love.

While both traditional and table tennis seems to favor taller competitors there are certain tricks and strategies shorter players can use to exploit their weaknesses. There are even a lot of cases where talented but short soccer players and baseball pitchers are being under-utilized over the years despite being good.

Many shorter swimmers are also perfecting their strategies for compensating for the lack of reach in the water. And while tall MMA fighters might seem intimidating their shorter opponents know exactly what they have to do in order to get a victory.

_nqmQ9YAtD8,nonclickbait,2058,"OK! Important Correction / Update. With some great detective work people have found that the loopy D was used VERY occasionally for DECADES before the 80s. The earliest use people have found is from a 1956 Mickey Mouse Club album ""Westward Ho the Wagons."" http://www.originalmmc.com/images/Records/DBR-67%20front.jpg

So, basically, they had this logo kicking around for decades in the print department as one of the many logotypes they would use...again, avoiding consistent branding. But the Loopy D was definitely not made in the 80s, which is bad news for finding the origin. Since it was developed in the 50s, the chances of all of the people who know the origin story being dead goes way up!",‚ÄòBUT THAT D THO‚Äô,I always thought it was a backwards G...,"You had me at, ""That D though!""","The ""y"" bothers me a lot more.","Ok, I'm calling the company Walt Gisnep from now on, lol",This is so much more interesting than I expected it to be. -John,"That thing flying over the castle isn't a star, man.

I always assumed all the older gens did that.,"I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A WEIRD BACKWARDS ""G""! Then someone pointed it out to me in college and it like, destroyed my entire world for awhile.","I am so bummed that this video isn't 15 minutes long. There is so much more to discuss. The Disney brand is fascinating, including the ways in which that brand reaches so far beyond any set of words or bands and into a deep cultural idea. It is, in some ways, outside of what we usually consider a brand, and in other ways maybe the most powerful brand outside of, like, nation states. 

Thanks to these people for their knowning or un-knowing help:

Here's a good tidbit I had to cut from this video...in 1922, which Ubbe Iwerks (co-creator of Mickey Mouse) first met Walt Disney, Walt was 19 years old and was literally practicing variations on his signature! Disney's constant variation of his signature apparently started at an early age, and the piece of his signature that he seemingly couldn't settle on was the D. In the end, it was likely not Disney who created this iconic D, but someone working at the company after his death. 

Walt Disney was obsessed with the ""Disney"" image...with his own image and that of his creations. That was certainly unhealthy. It also probably had some seriously negative consequences on him and the people around him. But it also played a part in creating something wonderful.

I REALLY HOPE I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING TOO WRONG IN THIS VIDEO!

Life in North Korea is no walk in the park, but it‚Äôs an even more difficult situation when you‚Äôre in the military. Serving in the military is something that the majority of North Korean citizens have to do when they reach adulthood‚Äîregardless of their gender or occupation. Spending a decade of your life doing something that you don't want to do doesn‚Äôt sound good to begin with. North Koreans also have to deal with all of the terrible conditions that soldiers are forced to live through. They have to steal to avoid starvation, they're forced to attack other countries, and they're not able to say no. Life is certainly difficult if you‚Äôre in the North Korean army. The conditions are so terrible that some soldiers do their best to leave illegally, which can end horribly if they're caught.

If you were to take a coffee cup, and break it in half, then in half again, and keep carrying on, where would you end up? Could you keep on going forever? Or would you eventually find a set of indivisible building blocks out of which everything is made? Jonathan Butterworth explains the Standard Model theory and how it helps us understand the world we live in.

The travel industry is one of the most profitable businesses out there. We have a huge planet to explore, families to visit, vacations to take...the list is endless. While the internet has given us a lot of tools to plan our own adventures, there are still travel agencies out there willing to help. Travel agents can usually plan your trip for free, and they will get a commission based on how much money you spend. But it goes much deeper than just getting your travel agent a cut of the money. There are also possibilities that you might not get reward points for airlines and credit cards if you book through a travel agent. Yet, you won‚Äôt hear a lot of travel agents talking about the downside of using their services. Furthermore, a travel agent‚Äôs job is to upgrade and make certain locations look as appealing as possible.

Y‚Äôall part of the problem.,"I‚Äôve been a server for seven years and have never once received a paycheck. It‚Äôs all taken for taxes on tips. We don‚Äôt make anything but tips. Get it right, please.",If they paid everyone a living wage and banned tipping then that would ban the power struggle. They would be able to kick people out for sexual harassment. In my country people don't tip unless they are in a strip club. Less hierarchy that way.,"Even when you're educated, women still get sexual harassed. ABC look into the nursing field. I'm sure you'll get a lot of stories there too.","This is disgusting,nobody should have to go threw this.","I worked in a restaurants through my 20s. The female staff received sexual harassment from every direction. The cooks, the management, customers. The drugs were rampant too.","I have been harassed if not worse, been followed, groped, stalked  and I‚Äôm a RN. Eventually had a breast reduction to avoid all the tit grabbing! Pigs are everywhere!","When I waited tables as an after school job it wasn't my boss groping me or saying revolting things to me as a 15 year old girl, it was the customers. As it happened I had a great boss, when I told him about a group of boys grabbing at me he threw them out, telling them they are not welcome there and yelling at them, insulting them in Cantonese. I was very, very lucky, I had a boss who respected me even as young as I was. Maybe my age had something to do with it, but I am thankful for having a protective and caring boss.","I've worked at Hooters, and my managers didn't tolerate any bs. They would literally cuss people out.",very sad when the truth comes out.. Always respect people no matter what work they do!,"Diane Sawyer reports on ""My Reality: A Hidden America"": Waitressing is a first job for many in the workforce and these women say they have dealt with lewd comments, inappropriate touching and predatory situations at work.

Aristophanes, often referred to as the Father of Comedy, wrote the world‚Äôs earliest surviving comic dramas. They're stuffed full of parodies, songs, sexual jokes and surreal fantasy -- and they‚Äôve shaped how comedy‚Äôs been written and performed ever since. Mark Robinson shares a brief history of Aristophanes.

And I agree, there is still a lot to root out. But there's one thing I can't shake: throughout its independent existence, India has never had a military coup. Never had a dictator take power. And quite frankly, that's better than much of the world, so kudos.","1/8th of the world‚Äôs population was eligible to vote in this election.

That blew my mind.","China: democracy  is not gonna work.

Elections in India aren‚Äôt like others. India voted to pick its central government for the next five years throughout the spring of 2019. An eighth of the world‚Äôs entire population was eligible to vote in this election. That‚Äôs 900 million people, and more than 67 percent voted.

India runs the world‚Äôs biggest elections, and officials put in a lot of effort to make this democratic exercise is as accessible as possible. This means they make sure everyone, even in the most remote locations, is near a polling booth ‚Äî even if it means bringing voting machines to them by elephant.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how India pulls off massive elections.

We live in the age of information. With satellites, undersea cables, cell towers and the internet, we can communicate and gather information in ways that our parents and grandparents could only dream about decades ago. As a species we‚Äôre pretty smart and over the last several centuries humans have built up their knowledge and abilities in every field of study. Yet, for being so smart and accomplished there are still a rather large number of things we can‚Äôt do - or are incapable of answering. For instance, despite all of our knowledge of the human body, there are still things we have absolutely no clue about. Despite all our space exploration and high-powered telescopes, we still don‚Äôt really know much about the worlds we‚Äôre surrounded by. Yes, there are still quite a few phenomena that amaze and baffle us because we just don‚Äôt have a definitive answer. And if there‚Äôs one thing that drives us humans crazy it‚Äôs not knowing the answers! So, sit back, get your thinking cap on and take a look at these events and occurrences that happen all around us. In some instances we think we know the answers ‚Äì but a definitive reason still eludes our tiny little brains.

Every single one of these riddles I thought I could solve but then switched off my phone and felt dumber than ever.,If the entire room is metallic what is the purpose of the light diffuser? Shouldn't the the room glow with mirrors on all sides.,*time to put my DVD screensaver knowledge to use*,"It's the SE corner. How do I get my answer?

_Let's draw the room in coordinates_","You‚Äôre a vampire hunter entering the enemy‚Äôs lair. Can you outsmart this tricky brainteaser and vanquish the vampires?

--

You‚Äôve stealthily descended into the darkness of a vampire cave, setting a sequence of mirrors as you go. When the sun reaches the right angle in the sky, a beam of light will ricochet along the mirrors, strike a diffuser, and illuminate the great chamber where the vampires sleep. Can you place the diffuser correctly and flood the lair with sunlight? Dan Finkel shows how.

YlX9STBgKW8,clickbait,441,5:00 Family on vacation??!!!?? I feel bad  for the kids that had to see that,"I had five brain surgeries in order to deal with a golf ball sized tumor crushing my optic nerves at the point where they cross in the hypothalamus. After most of the tumor was removed, a hard shelled cyst grew in its place, causing even more damage. My first two surgeries were through my nose, breaking through my sphenoid sinus with endoscopes. My next two were to attempt to place a drain in the cyst in order to keep it under control while I had radiation treatments. Both failed, because of the shell of the cyst. My last surgery was the most invasive. The skin on my head was cut and pulled away. I had a sizable chunk taken out of my skull at my right temple. The neurosurgeon then lifted my brain up to gain access to the cyst. It had to be cut open so the drain could be placed. My skull was reattached and I had 29 staples in my head. This left me with a long scar on the right side of my head.  I had an article written about me a year later in a popular magazine. Here it is if anyone wants to read it. https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/05/01/the-battle-to-save-a-boys-sight/",Music reminds me of Christmas music do you agree?,Finally a channel that doesn't clickbait,Why is the Christmas music The First Noel being used here? Lol,And that why I stay in home. Good and Safe,"Hey where am I? I survived 5 years of school so far, and survived going into the bathroom after my mom went in it",Cutting your own arm is very painful and i cant even imagine the bloods,"I don't have metal rods, but I have over 5 feet of scars as well as an amputation of my collarbone due to tumours.

Because discussions of climate change are often so very dire, I do end this video on a positive note. That's something I went back and forth on a lot. Ultimately, what we're dealing with here isn't simple in terms of causes, problems, or solutions. We do see that economics are already making renewables more attractive. That is the path of least resistance, but it is also the slowest way to go. 

We need governments to take action but that is an extremely tall order with a global crisis and competitive nations. Will this ultimately be a force that drives us apart? Or will it be something that brings us together. 

There is actually a more positive way of looking at the outcome of Game of Thrones thus far...a common enemy brought an end to some, but not all petty squabbling. And maybe the unification brought by an external threat created an alliance that will show that one last squabbler a very bad time.

It looks like the hammer obsession has finally ended; Hank has surrendered his hammer.,"Honestly, you could probably upload four minutes of crying and we'd make uplifting comments.",I loved that re-enactment ü§£,Hiding a hammer in the bushes won't look suspicious at all. üòÇ,John wanting more breaks and you wanting to do more is reminiscent of my eternal struggle in life.,"Audiobooks, UK signing, hammers in bushes! Much excitement! I consume a LOT of my books in audio book format so I have a lot of thoughts about how I like it done. Getting the test audio from the narrator was, for me, a bigger moment than seeing the cover or the printed book for the first time. Just so exciting! 

Also, when I say ""this"" ends in death, I think I mean ""everything eventually"" and not so much ""vlogbrothers."" Obviously, I am very uncomfortable with the idea that the vlogbrothers channel will end in the death of one of us and I don't know how to feel about that, which is, I guess, a pretty big part of the human experience. 

If you find the hammer please let me know so that people will know it's been found. Twitter is probably best!

So happy to be working with Kristen Sieh! While she has been in those TV shows I mentioned, most of her work is in theater, which you can find out about here: http://theteamplays.org/

This video helps a little.","John. I talked on the phone with you once while you were promoting Turtles All The Way Down. I was way more articulate than I thought I would be.

I've been fairly interested in porting it to mobile AR (when it's finished as it's still in early access). This is the kind of tech we want for the future of AR.

Eventually, AR will become more than games and fun apps as it will map the real world and tell us where we left our keys or whats in the fridge, but we'll maybe need AR glasses for that. When it's here, it will be the most lucrative industry of all time and they'll sell our infos like crazy.","It‚Äôs not a 9.7‚Äù iPad pro, it‚Äôs 10.5‚Äù iPad pro.",Yo Verge editing team!!!!

That's why it's so easy to focus on negatives.  It's way more important to the brain to make sure that you aren't in danger than it is to enjoy the things you do have.

As soon as I start talking about identity, and story, and how we determine who we are, I basically can keep going forever. So I hope this wasn't too much, but also didn't leave so much out that it feels empty and vacuous and useless or, worse, dangerously simplistic.

Particularly simplified is the idea that ""caring what other people think about you"" prevents you from being ""really bad."" I don't actually know if that's true. But I think that caring what other people think about you is, like, maybe the only thing that gives society and culture enough cohesion to operate productively.

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the surprising history behind sitcom lighting.

Karl Freund was the genius cinematographer behind Metropolis, the silent film classic. But then he designed the set for I Love Lucy - the first of the multicam, laugh-track heavy sitcoms. Today, they look bland, but it wasn‚Äôt always that way. But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.

These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits. What looks generic to our eyes was, at one time, the result of an artist who made the impossible look easy.

Most expectant fathers have a camera on hand so that they can record the birth of their baby. When a woman went to the hospital to give birth to her twin sons, her husband made sure that his phone was close by. He wanted to get a video of his twin sons right after they were born. He never expected to get the footage that he did. 
The baby boys were crying when they came out of their mother's womb. After getting cleaned up a bit, the boys were still crying. It seemed as though they couldn't be consoled. It wasn't long before something amazing happened. These boys were just an hour old, and they were able to prove how closely twins bond even immediately after they were born. Their father managed to catch the moment on film, and he is glad that he did. You have to see the video for yourself to believe it.

Want a few examples before we begin? Well, how about the fact that Matt LeBlanc only had $11 in his pocket when he was hired on the show, or that Matthew Perry once got into a physical argument with the Prime Minister of Canada! 

Not enough? Well, considering we‚Äôre The Richest, we‚Äôll also get into the exact salary and income figures of the six cast members, but you‚Äôll have to click play for that one. We can reveal one financial fact, however, which is that ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù still makes $1 billion a year in merchandise and syndication rights, and each of the main cast members gets two percent of that. This means that they get an automatic $20 million a year. We know: what a life!

The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important public health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won‚Äôt even have to cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from being transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Philip A. Chan explores the preventive strategies helping us tackle HIV and the possibility of ending the epidemic.

I would say the exodus of Hindus from that region after the conflict started in the 40s, has led to a significant disparity in what Kashmir once was and what it is now. I'm not sure if it's as just as it is presented to be, to simply poll the people of current Kashmir about what they think without giving any voice to all the Kashmiris who felt forced out of the region- by many of those same people who remained or migrated in. I guess that's one of the problems with multi generational conflicts. My grandmother's family will never get justice.","Who's gonna tell about Hindu genocide in Kashmir.

The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir is one of the longest running¬†conflicts. Ever since Britain left India in 1947 and hastily drew borders demarcating a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, Kashmir, located right between the two, has been fervently claimed by both nations.  

India and Pakistan‚Äôs first war was fought over Kashmir‚Äôs status as the the newly independent countries were being formed. After over a year of bloody conflict the UN stepped in and brokered a ceasefire that drew a line down the middle of Kashmir and gave a portion of the territory to India and the remainder to Pakistan. This arrangement was meant to be temporary. Once the violence settled a vote was to be held that would allow Kashmiris to decide their own future. 

But more than 70 years later, Kashmiris have yet to vote on their status. They remain stuck between two nuclear nations locked in a dangerous conflict with no end in sight.

In the early 1970s, a musical sensation took over New York City. It was called Disco. Before Disco became synonymous with Saturday Night Fever, Rod Stewart, and celebrity-fueled parties, it was an underground movement powered by the innovations of young DJs challenging themselves and each other to throw the city‚Äôs most adventurous dance parties. 

By 1973, their influence as musical taste makers became apparent, and a handful of unconventional dance tracks became pop crossover hits. With barely any radio airplay, songs like ""Love Theme"" and ""Girl You Need a Change of Mind"" became defining tracks of the disco era. 

These songs were repetitive, hypnotic, and funky, and they were also pretty long compared to other pop hits. That presented a problem for DJs using 7-inch 45rpm singles, which fit only 3:30 minutes of quality audio on them, during their night-long sets. They needed a vinyl record that could make their most popular tracks sound powerful on a dance floor and last the whole night. 

In 1976, an accidental studio discovery by Disco pioneer Tom Moulton provided the solution: A 12-inch single. By stretching one song across 12 inches of vinyl, a format typically reserved for full-length albums, those extended dance tracks had room to breath. 

By the 1980s, the 12-inch single dominated pop music. It not only changed the sound of records, it allowed for music producers to experiment with length and structure.
